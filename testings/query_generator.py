Comprehend the goal, and provide small web search queries to assist in achieving it. The queries should be based on finding the email of best individual person or an expert, to contact for helping or completing the user goal. First give the list of people/vendor (1 to 3) to approach for the goal (Eg- Professors, Catering Companies etc) in small strings as targets (focus on a person in 1-3 words). Then give search queries, always give search queries for `web` in a list of string(max 3), each targeting a target and slightly broaden the search(searching for their email). Give yelp and gmaps search query only if necessary for the goal.`yelp` and `gmaps` both are used for local businesses, including personal, small, and medium-sized enterprises, use both only when location is given by user (but don't use near me), else give an empty string. 'yelp' search query should NOT include location in its query string (Yelp does not accept location based search query, only vendor). The output should be in JSON format : "{\"targets\": [\"\",\"\"], \"queries\": {\"web\": [\"\", \"\"...], \"yelp\": \"\", \"gmaps\": \"\"}}
