Vertebrate eyes are complex sensory organs, defined as camera-type eyes. In the lab, we take full advantage of a newly established system, the golden apple snail Pomacea canaliculata , where - for the first time - full regeneration of adult camera-type eyes can be systematically explored at the molecular, cellular and genetic level. We use sequencing techniques, light microscopy and CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to expand our understanding of adult regeneration and stem cell biology. Our main goals are: identifying the cells that allow for regeneration, discover the gene regulatory network (GRN) that controls the regeneration of an adult eye and discriminate which components of this GRN are regeneration-specific and which one are shared with developmental programs. P. canaliculata is a great new platform to discover novel concepts in regeneration, plasticity and evolutionary conservation of the visual system.

Damian Genetos, PhD Dr. Genetos is an Associate Professor in the Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Cell Biology studying bone cell physiology and function in both normal and pathological skeletal states. One current project studies how HIF signaling, a major pathway in response to low oxygen conditions, integrates with the also very important TGF-beta signaling pathway in osteoblasts. Previous studies have also dealt with the genetic regulation of Sost, a Wnt and bone formation inhibitor. Students will be exposed to a variety of common molecular biology techniques such as RNA isolation, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting. Students will also participate in various aspects of cell culture. Previous experience is not required, but helpful. For more information, interested applicants can email Professor Damian Genetos ( dgenetos@ucdavis.edu [Contact:(mailto:dgenetos@ucdavis.edu)] ) their CV/resume and a copy of their transcript. Gregory Lanzaro The Vector Genetics Laboratory (VGL) at UC Davis deals with research and training in the areas of population & molecular genetics, genomics and bioinformatics of insect vectors of human and animal disease. We have developed a program aimed at expanding knowledge that may be applied to improving control of vectorborne diseases and that addresses problems of interest in the field of evolutionary genetics. The Laboratory is directed by Drs. Gregory C. Lanzaro and Yoosook Lee in the Dept. of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology of the School of Veterinary Medicine and Dr. Anthony Cornel in the Dept. of Entomology and Nematology at UC Davis. The VGL has a history of hosting well qualified undergraduate students who are interested in pursuing a career in biological/biomedical research. The lab offers students the opportunity of gaining experience working in an active research laboratory, to participate as author on papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals and most importantly to gain hands-on experience working with cutting edge methods in molecular biology. We are committed to providing qualified undergraduates students an excellent research experience and we expect a similarly high level of commitment from our students.

They are constantly sensing and responding to the brain environment. Several microglia states have been detected in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, each with a specific transcriptomic and proteomic signature suggesting essential roles in diseases. Using human stem cell models and single-cell omics, we aim to identify, track and manipulate microglia states to determine how they become awry in disease and their impact on patients\u2019 symptoms.

We are recently examining a nuclear migration event where the nucleus must deform to squeeze through a narrow opening. Once the nucleus has migrated to the correct location, there are mechanisms to anchor the nucleus there. Defects in nuclear positioning can lead to developmental defects and diseases such as Lisencephaly and Muscular Dystrophy. However, very little is known about the mechanisms of nuclear positioning. We are using the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study how nuclei and other organelles are positioned within a cell. We use imaging, genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches to study this basic problem in cell biology.

Altered patterns of connectivity are associated with neurological deficits: therefore, my research program focuses on investigating how environmental contaminants, chemical convulsants and inflammation perturb neuronal connectivity as determined using biochemical, morphogenic and electrophysiological endpoints. We are also developing biomarkers of OP neurotoxicity and testing novel therapeutic approaches for protecting against the neurodegenerative effects associated with neurotoxic pro-convulsants. Dr. Lein is affiliated with the following graduate groups: Pharmacology and Toxicology ; Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Physiolog y ; Neuroscience ; Integrative Pathobiology ; and Forensic Sciences . Dr. Lein is also a mentor for the Advancing Diversity in Neuroscience Research (ADNR) Honors Program at UC Davis, which supports diverse upper division undergraduate students who plan to pursue a PhD in neuroscience.

Email: cgrodzki@ucdavis.edu Donald Bruun Academic Program Management Officer-Lab Manager Home town: Shullsburg WI Education: B.S., Creighton University In our ever changing world there is a critical need to be able to respond quickly and effectively to exposures to neurotoxic chemicals. These chemicals may be released either accidentally or intentionally and have the potential for impacting large numbers of the population. Treatments must be developed to protect first responders and also minimize the neurological damage in individuals that survive the initial exposure. My research as part of the CounterACT project involves investigating novel neuroprotectants following acute exposures to organophosphates which are powerful acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or the rodenticide TETS which blocks GABAA receptors in the central nervous system. Our research indicates that anti-inflammatories and neural steroids may prove to be effective either alone or in combination to minimize the neural damage following acute intoxicant exposures. In my role as lab manager I work with lab members to ensure that every one is working safely and efficiently. When I am not in the lab I like spending time with my wife and dogs, creating stained glass and other objects of art, being outdoors, camping and going on the occasional bigfoot search.

As a third-year undergraduate, I was first introduced to biomedical research through joining the Lein lab as a research intern in CounterACT and completing an honors thesis on the evaluation of neurogenesis in a juvenile rat model of acute organophosphate intoxication. Upon graduation, I continued working in the lab as a junior research specialist investigating the role of the plasminogen activator system (PAS) as a biomarker and therapeutic target for mitigating neuroinflammation in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). As a graduate student, I am continuing my studies of the PAS in AD - specifically in its association with the neuroinflammatory response and in altering the blood-brain barrier (BBB). I am interested in its role as a mediator between the CNS and peripheral inflammation. Additionally, I will be determining the impact of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) on modulation of BBB integrity, microglial and astroglial activation, and AD-relevant pathology in the same transgenic rat model. Over the course of my scientific training, I hope to elucidate potential mechanisms of TRAP-induced neuroinflammation and BBB dysfunction.

        "content": "(how can you, when your classes have hundreds of students present?). And yet, some of the most important skills for research biologists cannot be taught in big lecture halls or even in lab courses; these skills, especially those linked to conducting cutting-edge research are best learned through close mentoring relationships with faculty, and through an opportunity to do research (try it, make mistakes, learn from those mistakes, and get it right the next time). The Research Scholars Program in Insect Biology aims to provide undergraduates with a closely-mentored research experience in biology. Because insects can be used as model systems to explore virtually any area of biology (population biology; behavior and ecology; biodiversity and evolutionary ecology; agroecology; genetics and molecular biology; biochemistry and physiology; cell biology), faculty in the program can provide research opportunities across the full sweep of biology. The program\u2019s goal is to provide academically strong and highly motivated undergraduates with a multi-year research experience that cultivates skills that will prepare them for a career in biological research. The program begins with students in their 1st and 2nd undergraduate years. Our goal is to develop a long-term mentoring relationship for students, to extend until the completion of the undergraduate program (usually 2 to 3 years).

Apply by February 5th. 2024 On the Programs & Pathways to Research and Advanced Degrees page we attempt to provide a listing of programs that offers research opportunities relevant to the Wildlife major. We encourage you to take a closer look at this spreadsheet , follow links and learn more about the many available programs. In addition you\u2019ll see a few pipeline to grad school programs listed as well. The Lloyd W. Swift Endowment Fund The Swift fund supports experiential learning for WFCB undergraduates and is intended as an enabling opportunity for students who would not otherwise have access to these opportunities. Students can therefore apply to secure funds for (1) research opportunities in a WFCB lab, (2) research opportunities outside WFCB, (3) external internships with wildlife, fish, or conservation organizations, or (4) fees for field courses. The WFCB undergraduate awards committee oversees the fund, makes policy decisions related to implementing the awards, and decides on awards recipients. The committee is composed of 5 members: an academic coordinator and the departmental CAO (both advisory), and 3 faculty (voting members). Pernille Sporon B\u00f8ving boving@ucdavis.edu [Contact:(mailto:boving@ucdavis.edu)] (WFCB Academic Coordinator) is in charge of coordinating undergraduate awards within WFCB and thus is the point person for the Swift opportunity. Eligibility, rules, and restrictions: Only WFCB majors may apply (minors are not eligible), and the award will only go to the student. More than 50% of the award period must occur while the student is enrolled. Consistent with university regulations, students may not be paid as undergraduate researchers beyond 1 quarter after they graduate. For example, if you graduate June 15th and the experience is 8 weeks long, then the first 4 weeks of the experience must take place prior to June 15th. For research experiences, the project supervisor can be a graduate student, postdoc, research staff, or faculty; preference will be given to supervisors affiliated with WFCB versus those in other departments on the UC Davis campus. Students must be in good academic standing to receive an award. Students who have violated the WFCB Principles of Community ( https://wfcb.ucdavis.edu/about/principles-community-wfcb ) may be denied awards. The maximum budget for an award is $7,500. Though students can apply for (and receive) multiple awards, no individual can receive more than $7500 over their career. Previous awardees seeking additional support from the Lloyd Swift Endowment should consider the amount in their previous award when designing budgets for subsequent proposals. No single organization (i.e., WFCB research lab or external organization) can receive no more than 5 awards in a year (i.e., from the Fall deadline to the following Fall deadline). Awards can occur at any time, including the summer, the academic year, or span both periods. Before applying, students must meet with a WFCB professor to discuss their application. If they are applying for a research opportunity within a WFCB lab, then this would be the lab\u2019s PI. If it is an opportunity external to"

Successful applicants will be encouraged to apply for a Lloyd W. Swift award to support their internship. BACKGROUND: The macroinvertebrate community is an important component of aquatic ecosystems and macroinvertebrate sampling is a common monitoring method employed by Cramer Fish Sciences (CFS) to assess functionality and success of our riverine habitat restoration projects. Macroinvertebrates are sensitive to environmental change and have been used by many studies to assess ecosystem health and restoration success. Invertebrate communities can provide an indication of habitat productivity. Additionally, juvenile salmonids primarily feed on a variety of drift macroinvertebrates and sampling this community can demonstrate resource availability for our most common focal species. STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Biomass is one of the most common metrics assessed for invertebrate samples. Our current protocols call for technicians to enumerate organisms by taxon, life stage, and size class with a sample and this information is used to estimate total sample biomass using standard biomass values for organisms. However, in many cases, biomasses are not available for a specific combination of taxon, life stage, and size class and we are required to substitute values from comparable taxa. Additionally, it would be helpful to measure expected accuracy of sample biomass estimates compared to direct sample weighing, which is more accurate but destructive. PROJECT GOALS: To contribute to a more complete and accurate table of biomass values and investigate accuracy of biomass estimates. POTENTIAL TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES: Collect data on missing biomass values \u2013 collect and"

The Wildlife Intake Center (WIC) Internship provides hands-on experience in the Gold Country Wildlife Rescue (GCWR) clinic working with injured and orphaned wildlife. Interns learn basic animal caretaking procedures, medical protocols, and in-depth species identification and natural histories. Interns will work alongside staff and other volunteers/interns to complete all tasks associated with animal rehabilitation. Interns will primarily work in the WIC helping with cage cleaning, animal feeding, medication distribution and other daily tasks. Some duties, however, may include animal pick-ups from vets, or special projects as needs arise. Gold Country Wildlife Rescue is a non-profit organization, dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation, and release of injured and orphaned wildlife. We are permitted through the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, and the US Fish & Wildlife Service. We have been serving the local community since 1991 and do so at no charge. Internship Location: 11251 B Ave., Auburn, CA 95603. Start/End Date : Applications are accepted on a rolling basis and admitted based on preset orientation dates. However, the best time to intern with us is during our busy baby season. Anytime from March through October we received our largest amount of animal intakes. During these months interns get to see and work with the largest variety of species. Orientations are typically held February, April, June, and August. Additional orientations are held as needed. Dates can be flexible depending on intern availability and seasonal needs. If interested in a specific timeframe, please contact volunteers@goldcountrywildliferescue.org for additional information. Minimum Age Requirement: 18+ years. Minimum Time Commitment: At least 16 hours per week, for a minimum total of 200+ hours over the course of the internship session. Housing/Transportation: No housing or transportation is provided to interns by GCWR. All housing and transportation arrangements are the responsibility of the intern. Salary: This an unpaid internship, but should you successfully land an internship with GCWR you become eligible to apply for a Lloyd W. Swift endowment as a WFCB major.
