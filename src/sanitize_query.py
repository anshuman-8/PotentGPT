Then give search queries, always give search queries for `web` in a list of string(max 3), each targeting a target and slightly broaden the search(searching for their email). Give yelp and gmaps search query only if necessary for the goal.`yelp` and `gmaps` both are used for local businesses, including personal, small, and medium-sized enterprises, use both only when location is given by user (but don't use near me), else give an empty string. 'yelp' search query should NOT include location in its query string (Yelp does not accept location based search query, only vendor). The output should be in JSON format : "{\"targets\": [\"\",\"\"], \"queries\": {\"web\": [\"\", \"\"...], \"yelp\": \"\", \"gmaps\": \"\"}}
