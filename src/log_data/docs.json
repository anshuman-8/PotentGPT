Guest List    Resources   Step-by-Step Guides  Proven Email Templates  Advanced Guide: \u2018How to Hire Wedding Vendors\u2019    Subscribe  \u00bb How (and why) to reject wedding vendors How (and why) to reject wedding vendors  December 13, 2017 by Katie   Last updated on January 14th, 2018 at 06:18 am Before I met my husband, I went on plenty of dates that went seemingly well, but the guy never called me back! \u00a0And then I was left wondering: Why? \u00a0What went wrong? \u00a0Should I call him? \u00a0Should I wait for him to call me?  If you can relate, then you know it\u2019s not cool to be left in the dark like that.  That\u2019s the same sort of thing that vendors go through when they don\u2019t hear back from you. \u00a0Vendors are people too and the polite thing to do is to let them know where they stand. \u00a0Below, I\u2019ll share some easy ways to let them down gently.  Why should you take the time to decline a vendor anyway?  The vendors you\u2019ve contacted had to take time to consider your request, answer your questions, and prepare a quote for you. \u00a0Some may follow-up with you to make sure you have everything you need; some may continue to check in with you until they get an answer. \u00a0The polite thing to do is to respond to vendors because ignoring them is just plain inconsiderate.   It doesn\u2019t take much effort to be polite and let them know where they stand \u2013 whether you\u2019ve decided to hire a competitor, whether you\u2019re still weighing your options, or whether you\u2019re still shopping around. \u00a0Either way, it\u2019s nice for them to know where they stand \u2013 and a quick email is all it takes.  And by the way, you won\u2019t hurt their feelings if you decline their service. \u00a0In fact, you\u2019re helping them close the loop on your request so that they can move on with their business.  You might also like this article:  How to email wedding vendors: My three-part template Declining a vendor could be the start of a negotiation  I\u2019d like to share a brief story about how we sent a rejection email to a caterer for our wedding \u2013 and how we ended up hiring that caterer after all!  We requested estimates from about a dozen different caterers \u2013 using my email template for wedding vendors , of course!  We had a strong preference for buffet service (because it\u2019s less expensive and we would eliminate the need to collect meal preferences from each guest \u2013 phew!). \u00a0One caterer actually charged more for buffet than plated service. \u00a0(That\u2019s just weird!)  A few days later, they asked if we had made a decision yet. \u00a0We thanked them for their time and shared that we were considering other caterers who didn\u2019t charge an extra fee for a buffet. \u00a0And guess what? \u00a0They offered to waive their additional fee for buffet service. \u00a0How cool is that!  If we had ignored their follow-up or refused to explain why we weren\u2019t considering them, we would have never gotten this offer!  I share this story to illustrate that in some cases, it might be beneficial to let a vendor know why you plan to decline their services \u2013 it could be the start of a negotiation.  Word-for-word scripts to let your wedding vendors down gently  To make it a littler easier for you, here are a few word-for-word scripts that you use can use for each of the following situations:   If you\u2019re still shopping around: \u201cThank you for the follow-up. \u00a0We\u2019re still waiting to hear back from a few other vendors before we move forward with our decision. \u00a0We hope to update you soon. \u00a0In the meantime, please let us know if you have any additional information about your services. \u00a0Thanks again.\u201d  If you\u2019re still deciding: \u201cThank you so much for following up. \u00a0We\u2019re still deciding between vendors, but we\u2019re happy to say that you\u2019re a top contender! \u00a0We hope to make our decision in the next several days. \u00a0We will update you soon. \u00a0Thanks.\u201d  If you\u2019ve hired another vendor: \u201cWe have decided to hire another vendor. Thank you so much for your time and attention. \u00a0All the best!\u201d   You might also like this article:  Questions to Ask Wedding Venues Give it a try!

It means that we do the work so you can be a Guest at your own event!        Our staff arrives on-site 1-2 hours before Guest arrival to load-in and set-up equipment needed for service.  We stay throughout your event to serve, replenish, and clean-up the food after Guest departure.  That includes bussing dirty dishes and pulling garbage at the conclusion of your event.  Full service pricing includes floor-length linens for your food and beverage tables (You provide the tables, please), chafers to keep hot food hot, stainless steel serving utensils, real serving platters, accent decor coordinated to your event colors, elevations and fresh greenery.  Guests eat with their eyes, too, and we want your event to look as fabulous as our food tastes!  Full service is highly recommended for events of 50 Guests or more and for events hosted in public venues and outdoor parks.  Planning for a smaller event and don't need service staff?

Catering setup included for non-residential orders.       How far in advance do I need to place my catering delivery order?  Place your order before 5 p.m. for next day lunch delivery. You can also place your order well in advance of your event date.

Or you can call or visit your local Olive Garden and our dedicated Catering Specialist will be happy to guide you through menu selections and delivery details.

Where do you deliver?  Start your order online to see if your event address can be serviced by one of our restaurants. We strive to deliver our food with the best quality and at the right temperature every time so we make sure that your food spends less time traveling and more time being enjoyed.       Can I pick up my catering order?  We offer both carside pickup and delivery services to meet your catering needs. You can order your favorite Italian Catering combinations online and pick up at an Olive Garden restaurant near you.       What size groups can you cater for?  We can handle anything from small to medium groups of 10 to 50 all the way to large occasions of several hundred people for your party or your meeting. We recommend placing orders online for events with 5 to 100 people - for larger groups call your local restaurant.       What is the minimum order for delivery?  The minimum order to qualify is $100 before taxes, coupons and 10% delivery fee.       Are your menu prices higher for deliveries?  We never mark up our menu prices for delivery. You pay the same for pickup or delivery and get the same abundant portions, food quality and value.       When is it appropriate to request chafing dishes and fuel?  For occasions where time between setup and service is extended or you have an event with a prolonged service, we recommend adding chafing dishes and warmers to your order to maintain food temperature. Also, chafing dishes are great when a higher level of presentation is wanted. Catering setup included for non-residential orders.      Join our eClub for news and\u00a0offers!
