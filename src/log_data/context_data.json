After getting out of the airport, I looked around for someone from Avis, but found no one. Waited for 45 mins and kept looking around, but no one arrived. Meanwhile asked around at the airport if there was any Avis counter, but there was none. Finally called the number provided by kayak, and the guy who picked up said it was the wrong number and put down the phone. I tried the number again, same guy picked up, this time"}, {"metadata": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297633-i7524-k6945823-Car_rental_reviews-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html", "content": "(/Profile/m_ajmera?tab=forum) m_ajmera Mumbai, India Level Contributor 37 posts 7 reviews 6 helpful votes 2.

Re: Car rental reviews 10 years ago Save Dear Mayank, Please also let me know if you happen to get reviews on a good car rental (/RentalCars-g297633-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html) agency. I have received quotes for my trip from 4 companies.

Re: Car rental reviews 10 years ago Save No, I haven't. Just booked through Expressions Kerala (expressionskerala@gmail.com), will let you know how it turns out. From talking to them, it seems the reviews are going to be a wash anyway. Most of these companies do not have their own cars (/RentalCars-g297633-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html) /drivers. They sub-contract it out to independent cars (/RentalCars-g297633-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html) /drivers. So you could get very different experiences on different trips from the same company.
