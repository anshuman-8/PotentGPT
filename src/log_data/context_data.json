        "content": "(USD) Description BOC Edwards iQDP80 (iQDP-80) Dry Semiconductor DryStar Vacuum Pump Rebuilt The iQ Drypumping System is a microprocessor controlled, modular, dry pump package that provides unparalleled control and monitoring facilities. The iQ pumping system can be locally controlled by a hand held LCD control panel or remotely controlled through a fully customized tool interface. All major control elements are located within the footprint of the pumping system.The iQ dry pumping system has integrated sensors, which continuously monitor key system performance parameters and give advanced warning of problems. These pumps have pump and motor temperature sensors installed. The iQ pumpset parameters can be monitored and displayed through a variety of output devices including: Hand-held or panel mounted control module; Local PC or laptop computer; OEM specified tool interface; PC as part of a fab-wide network. This is a hand held LCD control panel module provides access to: system control and configuration; system status and monitored values; diagnostics and recommended corrective action. A tool interface module can be used to provide a fully customized interface to your process tool. It communicates with the iQ pumping system through a screened twisted pair cable. It has integral system configuration which check process pump service history log, process/tool specific settings, updated on power-on, giving maximum pump interchangeability between process tools. Every dry vacuum pump we sell goes through a rigorous rebuild process at our Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM) location. Each pump is fully dismantled and all parts are decontaminated and inspected. Damaged or worn parts are replaced. All bearings, o-rings, seals, and gaskets are replaced. Rebuilt pumps are attached to our computer controlled pressure diagnostics system where their performance is monitored for 72-hours under varying load. Pumps are leak tested to ensure safety during operation. Final pump is cleaned and painted as required.

PN- A07115770 This is a motor for the Drypumping System microprocessor controlled, modular, dry pump package that provides unparalleled control and monitoring facilities. i/QDP pumps have enclosed, water-cooled motors and are therefore suitable for applications in clean environments where fan cooling is unacceptable.The pump-motor is cooled by water flowing through a cooling jacket which surrounds the motor. The pump-motor cooling circuit is separate from the pump cooling circuit. The cooling-water supply and return pipelines are connected to the pump by connectors on the water services panel at one end of the pump. The iQ dry pumping system has integrated sensors, which continuously monitor key system performance parameters and give advanced warning of problems including pump and motor temperature, by way of integrated sensors. Three motor-protection thermistors are fitted to the pump-motor (one on each winding). These thermistors are solid-state devices which have an electrical resistance of 100 to 500 Ohms at normal pump-motor operational temperature. When the pump-motor is too hot, the electrical resistance rises quickly to 3000 Ohms. The thermistors are connected in series and you can use the output of the thermistors to shut down the pump because the motor is too hot. These motors are supplied configured for \u2018low voltage\u2019 operation (200-208 V at 50 Hz or 200-230 V at 60 Hz). To change the i/QDP80 Pump-motor to \u2018high voltage\u2019 operation, remove the pump-motor terminal-box cover, then remove the wires from the U1, V1 and W1 terminals.

        "content": "(USD) Description BOC Edwards iQDP80 (iQDP-80) Dry Semiconductor DryStar Vacuum Pump Rebuilt The iQ Drypumping System is a microprocessor controlled, modular, dry pump package that provides unparalleled control and monitoring facilities. The iQ pumping system can be locally controlled by a hand held LCD control panel or remotely controlled through a fully customized tool interface. All major control elements are located within the footprint of the pumping system.The iQ dry pumping system has integrated sensors, which continuously monitor key system performance parameters and give advanced warning of problems. These pumps have pump and motor temperature sensors installed. The iQ pumpset parameters can be monitored and displayed through a variety of output devices including: Hand-held or panel mounted control module; Local PC or laptop computer; OEM specified tool interface; PC as part of a fab-wide network. This is a hand held LCD control panel module provides access to: system control and configuration; system status and monitored values; diagnostics and recommended corrective action. A tool interface module can be used to provide a fully customized interface to your process tool. It communicates with the iQ pumping system through a screened twisted pair cable. It has integral system configuration which check process pump service history log, process/tool specific settings, updated on power-on, giving maximum pump interchangeability between process tools. Every dry vacuum pump we sell goes through a rigorous rebuild process at our Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM) location. Each pump is fully dismantled and all parts are decontaminated and inspected. Damaged or worn parts are replaced. All bearings, o-rings, seals, and gaskets are replaced. Rebuilt pumps are attached to our computer controlled pressure diagnostics system where their performance is monitored for 72-hours under varying load. Pumps are leak tested to ensure safety during operation. Final pump is cleaned and painted as required.
