This world-renown teaching program was developed by the Japanese violinist, Shinichi Suzuki. His violin lesson method emphasizes the basic principles of language acquisition by applying them to music. Students learn to play by ear and by imitating the teacher. When practicing at home, the music student is helped by their parent or guardian who attends and observes the lessons. Students are also given recordings of the songs they are learning to help the music sink in. The California Conservatory of Music offers Suzuki guitar lessons, piano lessons, and violin lessons to Santa Clara, Redwood City, and Bay area students. We would love for you to come in and try a music lesson, or to talk further about this methodology by phone or email. Contact Us!

I'm wondering if anyone here can recommend a good advanced violin teacher in that area. In terms of level of playing in case that helps with your recommendations, I've done my AMUS level exam here in Australia just recently, playing the Bach partita in B minor, 3rd and 4th movement, Beriot's Scene de Ballet, Brahms' violin sonata no. 1 and Gershwin's Summertime and A Woman is a Sometime Thing. I'm 26 years old and have 2 kids, but I'm quite serious about continuing my violin studies, and so hoping to find a suitable teacher for that. Thanks so much in advance. /55428364/Vcom_Medium_Rectangle Replies Lydia Leong (http://www.violinist.com/directory/bio.cfm?member=lwl) November 2, 2015 at 03:56 AM \u00b7 I would considerate that to be an intermediate level of playing, rather than advanced -- you'll find plenty of teachers capable of teaching at the intermediate level. Do you know where you're going to live? The Bay Area encompasses a very wide geographic area, and driving time is hugely affected by the terrible traffic. There are abundant violin teachers in the area, so you will probably want to find someone that's within a reasonable drive. Alice Trimmer (http://www.violinist.com/directory/bio.cfm?member=Maud) November 2, 2015 at 02:54 PM \u00b7 Well if you rocked the Bourree from that Partita in your exam I would certainly think you are poised to study advanced literature. I can't help you with your question because I live in a different part of the country but if I were in your shoes I would contact the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. From what I saw on their website it does not look like they offer lessons to adults, but maybe they would help you with recommendations. Just be sure you talk to the teacher beforehand to be sure he or she is interested in teaching adults, not everyone is, and you need someone who will celebrate your interest in music and take it seriously. And welcome to the USA! The San Francisco area is stunning, although maybe not equal to the beauties of Australia. Lydia Leong (http://www.violinist.com/directory/bio.cfm?member=lwl) November 2, 2015 at 04:31 PM \u00b7 Some of the conservatory faculty also offer private lessons, including to adult amateurs, but to students more advanced than the OP (basically think \"amateurs skilled enough that they are doing some professional freelancing\"). Gene Wie (http://www.violinist.com/directory/bio.cfm?member=gwie) November 2, 2015 at 06:50 PM \u00b7 Give the folks in the music department at San Francisco State University a call or email, I'm sure they can recommend dozens of folks. Mayumi Wardrop (http://www.violinist.com/directory/bio.cfm?member=Mis0705) November 3, 2015 at 10:57 PM \u00b7 We're probably going to be settling around Palo Alto or Mountain View."}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://www.violinist.com/discussion/archive/27269/", "source": ["google"], "title": "Looking for violin teachers in the San Francisco/Bay Area"}, "content": "November 3, 2015 at 10:57 PM \u00b7 We're probably going to be settling around Palo Alto or Mountain View.

I would consider her rep to be entry level advanced, worth looking for an advanced teacher unless there's major technical remediation to do. I think your definition of advanced may be something like conservatory, professional or at least preprofessional level? Makes me curious if there is is a consensus here or if it depends on your measuring stick. (I'm a school-level teacher so I may be looking at things from a different angle!) Sorry no great suggestions for op except it's a beautiful area and I wish you the best success! Lydia Leong (http://www.violinist.com/directory/bio.cfm?member=lwl) November 4, 2015 at 06:49 AM \u00b7 I think of that as the late intermediate level. Advanced I would consider to be Bruch concerto and beyond. There are more teachers who can handle late intermediate through early advanced. There are many fewer teachers that can teach the top end of the repertoire and virtuosic technique. Suburbs to look at for teachers: Cupertino, Santa Clara, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, Redwood City -- more or less in order of south to north. I studied with Claudia Bloom in Palo Alto for a few years, when I lived in the Bay Area. Kathryn Woodby (http://www.violinist.com/directory/bio.cfm?member=kathrynwoodby) November 4, 2015 at 06:42 PM \u00b7 That makes sense. My own study through those levels was definitely not traditional, and so some of the pieces I am still \"filling in the blanks\" and putting in place for myself. What you say about the difference in levels does make sense with my experience on either side. Thanks for clarifying! Hopefully that provides some further guidance to mayumi as well! Karen Allendoerfer (http://www.violinist.com/directory/bio.cfm?member=ravena) November 6, 2015 at 01:07 AM \u00b7 I just moved to Mountain View CA. I had to leave behind a teacher in the Boston area who I loved. I've started lessons with someone new who is interesting, theory-oriented, very analytical. We seem to be a good fit. I'd say I'm \"advanced\" in terms of orchestral playing, which is the kind of playing I prefer to do most of the time. The most advanced piece I've done as a solo is either the 4th mvt of the Franck sonata or Bloch's Simchat Torah, but I haven't done either of those with this teacher. (I did them back in Boston.)

Violin Linda C. 4.9 (32) I have been a public school music teacher for 30+ years. I am an optimistic, enthusiastic person, who will help you learn music reading in addition to music playing. I started on piano as a young child, and studied clarinet from elementary school through college, where I focused on french horn. I have a BA in Music Education from Humboldt State University, where I also earned my teaching credential. I have taught beginning, intermediate and advanced band and orchestra, in addition to choir and jazz band. I have been music director for over 10 middle school musicals. In my spare time I enjoy my two dogs, going horseback riding, and reading. *** Lesson Details *** I am very friendly, and encouraging to new students. I have a lot of patience for those who are new to the study of music. I can also be more demanding for those who have learned the basics and want to improve their playing. I am a proponent of teaching the basics of music reading and common musical terms. I can teach music through a variety of curricula, and will work with my students to choose a method that best suits their goals. I have a large music studio in my home that has a separate entrance,which is conducive to music making (with it's own bathroom). I accept students 8 years of age and older. *** Studio Equipment *** Has a keyboard, but no drum set *** Travel Equipment *** I prefer to teach in my home studio. *** Specialties *** I have been teaching band, orchestra & choir in public schools for 30+ years.
