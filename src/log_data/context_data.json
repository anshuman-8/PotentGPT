I didn't really have a plan aside exploring and taking lots of photos on my travels. After a couple of weeks settling into the Indian way of life in Bangalore (also known as Bengaluru) I decided to fly to Kochi. Kochi (also known as Cochin) is a coastal city in India\u2019s southwest state of Kerala. I always prefer being near the coast and the area had been recommended to me by both tourists and Indians alike. As a bonus, India\u2019s largest arts event was being held in the city whilst I would be there, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2018 (http://www.kochimuzirisbiennale.org) . I spent a few days on the mainland of Kochi in the Ernakulam area before moving to the coastal area of Fort Kochi. Whilst in Ernakulam I experienced one of the elephant festivals which are popular throughout the state of Kerala. The festivals contain a large number of decorated elephants (http://www.flickr.com/photos/geezaweezer/47950825488) , elephant handlers (http://www.flickr.com/photos/geezaweezer/47941936621) \ufeff, music and dance.

Fort Kochi is an excellent place for photography. It is a small area which can easily be explored on foot. We wandered around for a few hours following the coastline and explored the many streets and alleyways within the town. Due to the Biennale there was a lot of art work around which when combined with people can make for some interesting street photography (http://www.flickr.com/photos/geezaweezer/45771320274) . The area has some beautiful old buildings as well as an interesting mix of Churches, Temples, Mosques and a Synagogue. The small town is still a place of work for the people who live there so there is plenty of authentic photographic opportunities to capture. The people are also very friendly and open to having their picture taken (http://www.flickr.com/photos/geezaweezer/44666572080) .
