These pumps have pump and motor temperature sensors installed. The iQ pumpset parameters can be monitored and displayed through a variety of output devices including: Hand-held or panel mounted control module; Local PC or laptop computer; OEM specified tool interface; PC as part of a fab-wide network. This is a hand held LCD control panel module provides access to: system control and configuration; system status and monitored values; diagnostics and recommended corrective action. A tool interface module can be used to provide a fully customized interface to your process tool. It communicates with the iQ pumping system through a screened twisted pair cable. It has integral system configuration which check process pump service history log, process/tool specific settings, updated on power-on, giving maximum pump interchangeability between process tools. Every dry vacuum pump we sell goes through a rigorous rebuild process at our Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM) location. Each pump is fully dismantled and all parts are decontaminated and inspected. Damaged or worn parts are replaced. All bearings, o-rings, seals, and gaskets are replaced. Rebuilt pumps are attached to our computer controlled pressure diagnostics system where their performance is monitored for 72-hours under varying load. Pumps are leak tested to ensure safety during operation. Final pump is cleaned and painted as required.

These pumps have pump and motor temperature sensors installed. The iQ pumpset parameters can be monitored and displayed through a variety of output devices including: Hand-held or panel mounted control module; Local PC or laptop computer; OEM specified tool interface; PC as part of a fab-wide network. This is a hand held LCD control panel module provides access to: system control and configuration; system status and monitored values; diagnostics and recommended corrective action. A tool interface module can be used to provide a fully customized interface to your process tool. It communicates with the iQ pumping system through a screened twisted pair cable. It has integral system configuration which check process pump service history log, process/tool specific settings, updated on power-on, giving maximum pump interchangeability between process tools. Every dry vacuum pump we sell goes through a rigorous rebuild process at our Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM) location. Each pump is fully dismantled and all parts are decontaminated and inspected. Damaged or worn parts are replaced. All bearings, o-rings, seals, and gaskets are replaced. Rebuilt pumps are attached to our computer controlled pressure diagnostics system where their performance is monitored for 72-hours under varying load. Pumps are leak tested to ensure safety during operation. Final pump is cleaned and painted as required.
