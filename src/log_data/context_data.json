Testimonials My son has had a great experience with the California Conservatory of Music. He has developed a love for all kinds of music and discipline to move through challenging pieces. This discipline and work ethic have transferred to other areas of his life as well. The teachers have been fantastic in developing a well-rounded musician and making the process enjoyable. Suzanne B. My kids have been taking lessons here since they were 2.5 and 5 years old.

We have three children taking lessons at the California Conservatory - ages 5, 7 and 10. Each child started in pre-school. It is truly amazing how they can work with children at such young ages and consistently teach them how to play so well. The program is amazing - individual lessons, group lessons, small group and large group performances, and parental involvement. The staff is talented, engaging, patient, and so wonderful.

During this time, my students have progressed and enjoyed their lessons so much that they tend to stick around for years! I've had students accepted into Eastman School of Music, Mannes School of Music, Bard Conservatory, Meadowmount School of Music, Johns Hopkins Peabody Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, and California CODA Honors/All-State Orchestras. These are some of the world's most prestigious and competitive music institutions. My student Julian Hsieh has won 1st place in the 2019 VOCE state competition Senior Ensemble category and performed at the 2019 MTAC convention VOCE recital in Santa Clara, CA (watch his performance here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6DXM1OSz-o&feature=youtu.be (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6DXM1OSz-o&feature=youtu.be) ). Julian was also selected as a participant in one of the prestigious 2020 Lessonface MET Orchestra Musicians Master Classes. My student Jason Hurlbut was chosen to accompany Moscow Ballet Principal Ballerina Anna Radik at Copley Symphony Hall in San Diego in a performance of Saint-Saens \"Dying Swan\" as part of their 2015 Musical Wunderkind program (watch his performance here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua3na8f9Hb8&list=ULY9_E29Nfum8&index=177 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua3na8f9Hb8&list=ULY9_E29Nfum8&index=177) ) . I am also co-host of the YouTube channel \"10 Minute Violin,\" https://www.youtube.com/c/10MinuteViolin (https://www.youtube.com/c/10MinuteViolin) which is dedicated to releasing weekly 10 minute videos with which students can practice along and improve aspects of their playing (scroll past my picture on the top right of this page to watch my latest videos!). I welcome and enjoy teaching all ages and levels, though my focus has been working with students ages 7-18. In addition, I have also instructed and conducted orchestra at the San Diego Youth Symphony & Conservatory for 8 years, New Youth Orchestra for 6 years, and school orchestras in the San Diego area. I grew up in a musical family and had began my studies on violin with my father Margarito Ramirez and my brother John Ramirez who had attended the Juilliard School under the tutelage of Dorothy DeLay. I had also studied with Michael and Irina Tseitlin, and Philipp Naegele. I have had the privilege of taking individual classes with my uncle Juan Ramirez (Atlanta Symphony Orchestra), David Chan (Juilliard School, Metropolitan Opera), Mikhail Kopelman (Eastman School of Music), and Oleh Krysa (Eastman School of Music). My performance experience ranges from playing classical music at the Viana do Castelo VIII International Music Festival in Portugal to performing viola alongside rock band Delta Spirit at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. Parent testimonial: I could not have found a better violin teacher, mentor, role model or friend for my child than I did with Miguel Ramirez. Kindness and patience embodied, with an extraordinary musical ear, he transformed my son\u2019s violin practice from an obligation into a passion. A gifted teacher with an inspirational love of violin and impressive expertise, Miguel Ramirez nurtured my now aspiring musician from weekly grade school lessons through to acceptance into the prestigious Meadowmount School of Music summer intensives, and ultimately into college at the Eastman School of Music. Thank you, Miguel\u2026 we miss you!! - Lori Williamson, Jason Hurlbut's mom Teaching Style (#teaching-style__content) During my lessons, I like to encourage,"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://www.thecaliforniaconservatory.com/suzuki-program/", "source": ["google"], "title": "Suzuki Method - Violin Lessons For Santa Clara & Redwood City"}, "content": "Skip to content (#fl-main-content) Now offering In-Person & Online Lessons!

This world-renown teaching program was developed by the Japanese violinist, Shinichi Suzuki. His violin lesson method emphasizes the basic principles of language acquisition by applying them to music. Students learn to play by ear and by imitating the teacher. When practicing at home, the music student is helped by their parent or guardian who attends and observes the lessons. Students are also given recordings of the songs they are learning to help the music sink in. The California Conservatory of Music offers Suzuki guitar lessons, piano lessons, and violin lessons to Santa Clara, Redwood City, and Bay area students. We would love for you to come in and try a music lesson, or to talk further about this methodology by phone or email. Contact Us!

Violin Linda C. 4.9 (32) I have been a public school music teacher for 30+ years. I am an optimistic, enthusiastic person, who will help you learn music reading in addition to music playing. I started on piano as a young child, and studied clarinet from elementary school through college, where I focused on french horn. I have a BA in Music Education from Humboldt State University, where I also earned my teaching credential. I have taught beginning, intermediate and advanced band and orchestra, in addition to choir and jazz band. I have been music director for over 10 middle school musicals. In my spare time I enjoy my two dogs, going horseback riding, and reading. *** Lesson Details *** I am very friendly, and encouraging to new students. I have a lot of patience for those who are new to the study of music. I can also be more demanding for those who have learned the basics and want to improve their playing. I am a proponent of teaching the basics of music reading and common musical terms. I can teach music through a variety of curricula, and will work with my students to choose a method that best suits their goals. I have a large music studio in my home that has a separate entrance,which is conducive to music making (with it's own bathroom). I accept students 8 years of age and older. *** Studio Equipment *** Has a keyboard, but no drum set *** Travel Equipment *** I prefer to teach in my home studio. *** Specialties *** I have been teaching band, orchestra & choir in public schools for 30+ years.

All students at CCM meet weekly with their private instructor for music class at our Santa Clara or Redwood City music studio. Our faculty takes into account the unique learning styles of each student, their musical background, age, and musical goals to create a clear plan and curriculum for the music students to follow. We strive to give beginning students a solid instrumental technique and a thorough understanding of music. Music lesson students who are beginners can expect to learn the fundamentals of note reading, rhythm, and technique while also exploring their own musical interests and basic repertoire. More intermediate and advanced students continue their technical and musical development through more ambitious repertoire. Many music students also participate in performances outside of CCM including regional, national, and international competitions, and adjudications such as the Royal Conservatory Music Development Program or ARBSM. Our school's goal is to spread a love and appreciation of music to students throughout the Bay Area. From San Mateo all the way to San Jose hundreds of music students have chosen The California Conservatory of Music for their guitar lessons, piano lessons, violin lessons, or voice lessons. If you or your child is interested in music lessons in Menlo Park, Belmont, San Carlos, Redwood Shores, Foster City, San Jose, Milpitas, or Sunnyvale, reach out to us at either our Redwood City or our Santa Clara CCM location!
