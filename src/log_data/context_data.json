As AI plays an increasingly important role in society, it is critical to understand both the ethical factors that influence the design of AI and the ethical dimensions of the impacts of AI in society. The goal of this course is to prepare AI professionals for the important ethical responsibilities that come with developing systems that may have consequential, even life-and-death, consequences. Students first learn about both the history of ethics and the history of AI, to understand the basis for contemporary, global ethical perspectives (including non-Western and feminist perspectives) and the factors that have influenced the design, development, and deployment of AI-based systems. Students then explore the societal dimensions of the ethics and values of AI. Finally, students explore the technical dimensions of the ethics and values of AI, including design considerations such as fairness, accountability, transparency, power, and agency. Students should take this course to prepare them for the ethical challenges that they will"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://cdso.utexas.edu/msai", "source": ["google"], "title": "Master's in Artificial Intelligence | Computer & Data Science Online"}, "content": "Professor, Electrical & Computer Engineering Important Dates Fall Application Application Opens December 15 Priority Deadline April 1 Final Deadline May 1 Spring Application Application Opens June 1 Priority Deadline August 15 Final Deadline September 15 Please note: Applying to UT Austin is a twofold process.

This is the end of the admissions process, but you still have a long way to go to join our program. 6. International students will now have to provide proof of funds for our Office of International Students to issue you an I-20. This may require a bank statement or a bank loan. Domestic students may skip to Step 8. 7. After receiving your I-20, schedule a visa appointment at your nearest US consulate or embassy. Depending on applicant volume, it may take months to get a visa appointment. If you don\u2019t get your visa appointment in a timely manner, you may have to defer your joining date to the following semester. Let us know if you choose to defer. If you change your mind and want to join another university, you will have to restart your I-20 process with your new university and get a new visa, which may further delay your arrival to the USA by several more months. 8. Inform us via e-mail when your visa is approved, so that we can register you for classes for your first semester. Your first semester classes are Machine Learning (using Python), Analytical Methods in Business (using R), and Advanced Database Management Systems, if you meet program prerequisites. Students not meeting prerequisites will have to take remedial classes first, which may delay their graduation from the program. 9. Plan to arrive to our campus at least one week before the start of the semester. This is the time when we do orientation sessions and conduct free workshops (bootcamps) on R and Python \u2013 the two programming languages you must know for your first day of class. If you miss these bootcamps, it will be your responsibility to learn these tools on your own. Our professors don\u2019t teach programming in class; they assume that you attended the bootcamps, are conversant in these tools, and are ready to use them to build statistical models and machine learning models in your first semester. This extra week will also help you find an apartment to stay, which are quite difficult to get at the start of any semester. 10. Upon arrival to the USF, apply for a USF ID card and NetID. NetID is your single sign on (SSO) access for USF computer systems, including our library, Canvas learning management system (which hosts all our class information), Oasis course registration system, Banner grade system, and many others. Costs Florida has one of the lowest tuition costs of all states in the United States. Our tuition and fees can be calculated using our online tuition calculator at http://usfweb.usf.edu/graduate-studies/tuition-and-fee-calculator/ (enter \u2018Graduate (Business, Engineering)\u2019 in the Program Level drop down menu; the MS-BAIS program is a minimum of 33 credits, not including any outstanding prerequisites). As of 2022, the out-of-state tuition and fees for a two-year MS-BAIS degree for an international student is approximately $30,000. Students should also include another $15,000-20,000 for two years of living expenses while in the program. Graduate Assistantships We have a limited number of graduate (teaching) assistantships, which typically make students eligible for a lower, in-state tuition and pays for their health insurance during their term of assistantship, in addition to providing them a monthly stipend. Assistantship decisions are highly competitive and made on a semester-to-semester basis, based on students\u2019 performance in prior semesters at USF, their work ethic, and their ability to assist us with undergraduate and graduate classes. For example, we will only hire students with a strong background in statistics as teaching"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://www.usf.edu/business/graduate/ms-bais/", "source": ["google"], "title": "MS in Business Analytics / Information Systems (MS/BAIS) | USF ..."}, "content": "basis, based on students\u2019 performance in prior semesters at USF, their work ethic, and their ability to assist us with undergraduate and graduate classes. For example, we will only hire students with a strong background in statistics as teaching assistants for our statistics classes. Assistantships are not available in your first semester at USF, but will be available from the second semester onwards, based on your performance in prior semesters at USF. Note that assistantships are not merit-based or need-based scholarships, they are on-campus jobs, for which you are expected to work for 20 hours/week as assigned by your supervising professor. Additional on-campus job opportunities are available as graduate assistants in other offices, departments, and centers on the USF campus, for example, at our Dean\u2019s office, the Provost\u2019s office, at USF Library, our INTO program office, USF Morsani Center of Medicine, USF Center for Urban Transportation Research, and other departments on campus. These jobs typically require specific skills such as Power BI, coding, and so forth. These are university-wide positions, and students are selected based on their fit with job requirements. Our students are often considered favorably for these positions because of their strong technical skills. Only students already enrolled at USF have access to such positions on an internal USF portal. Incoming international students cannot apply for these jobs from their home countries. Students can also do paid full-time or part-time internships at a US company for a maximum of 12 months as part of the curricular practical training (CPT) option of the program, while fully retaining their 18-month optional practical training (OPT) to secure a job and a work visa upon completion of their MS-BAIS degree. You must complete two semesters of coursework at USF to be eligible for an internship. Our students often get internship positions in prestigious companies like Amazon, BMW, and JP Morgan Chase, and many of these internships often convert into full-time positions upon graduation. CURRICULUM The Master of Science in Business Analytics & Information Systems (Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Analytics) requires 33 hours of coursework, plus any necessary prerequisite courses, and may be taken either full-time or part-time. This includes 15 credit hours of required courses (core courses and capstone) and 18 credit hours of electives. Typically, most courses are 3 credit hours. Full-time students with appropriate prerequisites may be able to complete the major in 3-4 semesters of study. Part-time students will typically need from 2-3 years to complete the degree. Optionally, students can choose one of three possible concentrations\u2014analytics and business intelligence, Fintech, and information assurance\u2014by choosing a certain set of elective courses recommended for each concentration. The required courses are the same for each concentration. However, a concentration is not necessary to complete your degree. For details about our required classes, electives, and prerequisites, please refer to our catalog (https://usf.edu/grad-catalog-business-analytics-and-information-systems-ms) . For more information on our coursework or prerequisite requirements, feel free to contact the program advisor below. Global executive Program This Global Executive Master of Science in Business Analytics & Information Systems program (/business/graduate/ms-bais-global/index.aspx) is designed for full-time, working professionals worldwide. This is a fully online program with 100% live instruction that combines information systems and business analytics courses. This program offers a predetermined set of required and elective courses in a lockstep format, without the flexibility or customizability of our regular program. Since students in this executive program are already full-time working professionals, our extracurricular support (bootcamps, internships, job placement, etc.) are not available to students in this program.

ARE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR MERIT-BASED SCHOLARSHIPS? Yes, international students are eligible for merit-based scholarships and are automatically reviewed for scholarship by our admissions committee at the time of admission. Additionally, international students are eligible for on-campus job opportunities and graduate assistantships. DO I NEED TO SUBMIT A NACES EVALUATION OF MY TRANSCRIPTS? The following students must submit an approved NACES evaluation. For a list of approved NACES members please check here http://www.naces.org/members.html Transfer Applicants Graduate Applicants in designated majors. The majority of graduate programs at LIU do not require a NACES evaluation. Please visit your program website for more details at LIU Brooklyn or LIU Post. DO MY TRANSCRIPTS NEED TO BE IN ENGLISH? Yes, all transcripts must be submitted in English. Please inquire with your prior institution about translation services or professional translation services in-country are acceptable. DO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS NEED TO SUBMIT PROOF OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TESTING OR QUALIFY FOR A VALID WAIVER TO STUDY AT LIU? Yes, all international students must submit ELPT or qualify for a valid waiver to study in the US. HOW CAN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH DACA STATUS, APPLY FOR ADMISSION ON THE LIU ONLINE APPLICATION? \u201cVisa Type\u201d is a required question for non-U.S. citizens on the LIU online application for admission. As an undocumented student, you have the option to select \u201cOther\u201d at the bottom of the dropdown list for this question. This option is considered a valid response and we recommend this choice for undocumented applicants, including those with DACA status. IF THE DACA PROGRAM IS CANCELED OR REVOKED, WILL MY STATUS AS AN ENROLLED STUDENT PROTECT ME FROM DEPORTATION? Enrolled student status does not necessarily provide protection from removal; however, a 2011 memo from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) designates college campuses as \u201csensitive locations,\u201d meaning that college campuses would not be the focus of law enforcement actions (i.e. arrests, searches, interviews, and surveillance) unless: (a) exigent circumstances exist; (b) other law enforcement actions have led officers to campus; or (c) prior approval is obtained. HOW CAN REFUGEES AND ASYLEES IN THE UNITED STATES APPLY FOR ADMISSION ON THE LIU ONLINE APPLICATION? \u201cVisa Type\u201d is a required question for non-U.S. citizens on the LIU online application for admission. As a Refugee or Asylee, you have the option to select \u201cRefugee/Asylee\u201d at the bottom of the dropdown list for this question. This option is considered a valid response and we recommend this choice for Refugees and Asylees AM I CONSIDERED AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT IF I AM \u201cPERMANENT RESIDENT PENDING?\u201d Yes, you are considered an international student if you are Permanent Resident Pending or I-485 Pending. \u201cVisa Type\u201d is a required question for non-U.S. citizens on the LIU online application for admission. As a student who is PR Pending or I-485"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://liu.edu/brooklyn/admissions/international", "source": ["google"], "title": "International | Long Island University"}, "content": "Resident Pending or I-485 Pending. \u201cVisa Type\u201d is a required question for non-U.S. citizens on the LIU online application for admission.

This option is considered a valid response and we recommend this choice for applicants who are PR Pending or I-485 Pending. *An individual who has filed the I-485 application to adjust his or her status from a non-citizen to become a Permanent Resident is considered to be Pending for Permanent Residency (PR Pending or I-485 Pending). Like the Permanent Resident, the PR Pending may also enroll at LIU without any special visa or authorization from the International Admissions Office at LIU. This means that these students are not required to have an F-1 visa to study at LIU. It may be months or years before the pending status is resolved, so students should be aware of their options and the potential benefits and consequences of each. **The information above is only for informational purposes and should not be construed as legal advice.
