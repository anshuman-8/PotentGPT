We heard from dozens of our friends how awesome and amazing the food was. One person said they would never be satisfied eating sushi from other places. The time and care you put into each dish was evident to all. This was a meal they will never forget. Mike & Mae C. Sunnyvale, CA If you're searching for an incredible caterer, look no further Greenfish is the best in the Silicon Valley (in my humble opinion). I work at a company that uses a lot of catering. So I've come across all different types of vendors, good and bad. Greenfish impresses me the most because they go out of their way to make sure their customers are taken care of and fully satisfied. They will customize the order to your liking. They take their profession seriously and your satisfaction is their number one priority.

The fall chill was in the air that day but as we pulled up their wedding at Oyster Ridge in Santa Margarita, CA; the sun was shining and it was a GORGEOUS day! Oyster Ridge is a stunner of a wedding venue folks. It\u2019s surrounded by vineyards on all sides and as you walk up you are greeted by a ginormous oak tree with a beautiful and sprawling canopy. The patio is so tastefully styled, and the barn is rustic yet welcoming. (They have a kitchen too which we always appreciate!) Cathy, Chef Cody, the Two Steves, and Nanci comprised our team for the day, and they were on it!
