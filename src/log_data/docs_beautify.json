My name is Tim and I am a violinist, educator, and business person. Currently, I am a teacher at SUNY Potsdam where I teach violin and music business. As a violinist, I have been a life-long student of music. I began my studies at age four at the Preucil School of Music (http://www.preucil.org/aboutPreucil.html) in Iowa City. I studied with a long list of teachers (I\u2019ll list them at the end) that helped me develop and shape my style as a violinist and educator. I also studied violin abroad with two great teachers, Alexander Kirov in Moscow and Anatolly Davidovitch Reznikovsky in St Petersburg. From those experiences, I gained a lot of first-hand knowledge of Russian pedagogy, technique, and artistic style. My time at UW-Madison set a trajectory in my career as an educator and the subjects I would later teach. I have also researched Suzuki pioneer John Kendall for my doctoral project and was given an award (https://artsdivision.wisc.edu/programs/arts-awards/2021-recipients/) for my research. I was able to secure several grants to study about Kendall through his physical archive. In Madison, I was able to assistant teach Music History. I also was a program manager at the Division of Diversity and supported many students of color on the UW campus. Because of my interest in pedagogy, I went to Indiana to work with Mimi Zweig, a top pedagogue in the field of string education. I completed a performer\u2019s diploma at Indiana University Bloomington , where I helped teach at the IU String Academy. In Bloomington, I also worked at Fairview Elementary School teaching violin group classes, and I helped with administration at the Jacob\u2019s Academy for their summer programs. Now, I am on the violin faculty at SUNY Potsdam in New York where I teach violin, chamber music, a gen-ed course on BIPOC and Women composers, and music business. I have also been involved in the Lougheed Center for Applied Learning as an applied learning fellow where I offered career counseling. Throughout this journey, many of my students have found success in meeting their musical goals, whether it is getting into college, entering an orchestra, participating in a competition, or learning for personal enrichment ( See Student Achievements (http://timyipviolin.com/student-achievements/) ). I have felt very happy to see them pursue and achieve great things in and outside of music.

Chamber music with Antonio Lysy, Paul Colleti, Igor Gavrish, and Austin Hartman Here is my short professional bio With a comprehensive background as a pedagogue, Dr. Timothy Yip has dedicated many years to instructing students at all levels. Before moving to New York, he had taught violin in the San Francisco Bay Area for over a decade and has provided coaching and adjudication for regional student orchestras. Timothy\u2019s expertise has contributed to the success of numerous students, including top-place winners in both regional and national competitions. Additionally, Timothy has been adjudicated in New York for competitions hosted by MTNA and the Crane School of Music. In his pursuit of a well-rounded skill set, Timothy ventured into the field of business and entrepreneurship. He pursued business studies at UCLA\u2019s Anderson School of Management, San Jose State University (where he earned his MBA), and Harvard Business School Online. His diverse experience includes establishing an award-winning private studio, assuming administrative responsibilities at the Division of Diversity at UW-Madison, managing operations of youth symphonies in the Bay Area, leading teams in the software development space, and playing a key role in the launch and support of multiple top-grossing mobile applications. Timothy attended UCLA, UW-Madison, Indiana University (where he served as a teaching assistant to Mimi Zweig), and the St. Petersburg Conservatory.

Testimonials My son has had a great experience with the California Conservatory of Music. He has developed a love for all kinds of music and discipline to move through challenging pieces. This discipline and work ethic have transferred to other areas of his life as well. The teachers have been fantastic in developing a well-rounded musician and making the process enjoyable. Suzanne B. My kids have been taking lessons here since they were 2.5 and 5 years old. I was skeptical about starting music lessons so early, but I have come to appreciate the value of the Suzuki method as I\u2019ve seen, now seven years later, the rewards in their musical ability, confidence, self-motivation, and love of music. We love the owners, Chris and Rob, and their dedication to excellence balanced with gentle motivation. Jacki R. We have three children taking lessons at the California Conservatory - ages 5, 7 and 10. Each child started in pre-school. It is truly amazing how they can work with children at such young ages and consistently teach them how to play so well. The program is amazing - individual lessons, group lessons, small group and large group performances, and parental involvement. The staff is talented, engaging, patient, and so wonderful.

During this time, my students have progressed and enjoyed their lessons so much that they tend to stick around for years! I've had students accepted into Eastman School of Music, Mannes School of Music, Bard Conservatory, Meadowmount School of Music, Johns Hopkins Peabody Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, and California CODA Honors/All-State Orchestras. These are some of the world's most prestigious and competitive music institutions. My student Julian Hsieh has won 1st place in the 2019 VOCE state competition Senior Ensemble category and performed at the 2019 MTAC convention VOCE recital in Santa Clara, CA (watch his performance here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6DXM1OSz-o&feature=youtu.be (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6DXM1OSz-o&feature=youtu.be) ). Julian was also selected as a participant in one of the prestigious 2020 Lessonface MET Orchestra Musicians Master Classes. My student Jason Hurlbut was chosen to accompany Moscow Ballet Principal Ballerina Anna Radik at Copley Symphony Hall in San Diego in a performance of Saint-Saens \"Dying Swan\" as part of their 2015 Musical Wunderkind program (watch his performance here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua3na8f9Hb8&list=ULY9_E29Nfum8&index=177 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua3na8f9Hb8&list=ULY9_E29Nfum8&index=177) ) . I am also co-host of the YouTube channel \"10 Minute Violin,\" https://www.youtube.com/c/10MinuteViolin (https://www.youtube.com/c/10MinuteViolin) which is dedicated to releasing weekly 10 minute videos with which students can practice along and improve aspects of their playing (scroll past my picture on the top right of this page to watch my latest videos!). I welcome and enjoy teaching all ages and levels, though my focus has been working with students ages 7-18. In addition, I have also instructed and conducted orchestra at the San Diego Youth Symphony & Conservatory for 8 years, New Youth Orchestra for 6 years, and school orchestras in the San Diego area. I grew up in a musical family and had began my studies on violin with my father Margarito Ramirez and my brother John Ramirez who had attended the Juilliard School under the tutelage of Dorothy DeLay. I had also studied with Michael and Irina Tseitlin, and Philipp Naegele. I have had the privilege of taking individual classes with my uncle Juan Ramirez (Atlanta Symphony Orchestra), David Chan (Juilliard School, Metropolitan Opera), Mikhail Kopelman (Eastman School of Music), and Oleh Krysa (Eastman School of Music). My performance experience ranges from playing classical music at the Viana do Castelo VIII International Music Festival in Portugal to performing viola alongside rock band Delta Spirit at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. Parent testimonial: I could not have found a better violin teacher, mentor, role model or friend for my child than I did with Miguel Ramirez. Kindness and patience embodied, with an extraordinary musical ear, he transformed my son\u2019s violin practice from an obligation into a passion. A gifted teacher with an inspirational love of violin and impressive expertise, Miguel Ramirez nurtured my now aspiring musician from weekly grade school lessons through to acceptance into the prestigious Meadowmount School of Music summer intensives, and ultimately into college at the Eastman School of Music. Thank you, Miguel\u2026 we miss you!! - Lori Williamson, Jason Hurlbut's mom Teaching Style (#teaching-style__content) During my lessons, I like to encourage, challenge, and focus. Since learning violin is a long process, I think it is important to first offer words of affirmation to students about when they are on the right track. I will then work together with the student to further refine and reinforce those technical and musical strengths, or perhaps shift over to work on a particular difficulty the student may be encountering. In either case, I try to focus the student on one or two specific tasks that will help improve their playing. I have told students that this work is like adding coins to a piggy bank, each new or corrected motion is like adding a coin, over time it will add up to a beautiful technique. I emphasize a strong technical foundation, and follow the Sassmannshaus tradition of introducing advanced techniques in their basic form, even to beginners and young children. I support each student in their individual musical goals and will recommend a specific number of minutes to practice each assignment based on those goals. I also give the student practice strategies based on the science of how the brain works to help increase the efficiency of their practice sessions. I highly encourage each student to use a timer and practice sheet to track how many minutes they have practiced each assignment. This not only helps a student stay consistent and feel accomplished, it can also make the practice time feel like it goes by faster as the student is more engaged in what they are doing. During lessons, I make use of a couple devices, a metronome and a drone, which can help students with their rhythmic and pitch accuracy, and encourage students to continue to use those devices regularly in their individual practice time.

This world-renown teaching program was developed by the Japanese violinist, Shinichi Suzuki. His violin lesson method emphasizes the basic principles of language acquisition by applying them to music. Students learn to play by ear and by imitating the teacher. When practicing at home, the music student is helped by their parent or guardian who attends and observes the lessons. Students are also given recordings of the songs they are learning to help the music sink in. The California Conservatory of Music offers Suzuki guitar lessons, piano lessons, and violin lessons to Santa Clara, Redwood City, and Bay area students. We would love for you to come in and try a music lesson, or to talk further about this methodology by phone or email. Contact Us!

Sarkis N. 1 Violin lesson To make matters worse I chose the violin for him so that he can learn an instrument that would make him feel unique. I interviewed many teachers - many! I even tried one with no success. Then I figured to give Ilona a try. Remember, my child has never touched a violin before and in just his first lesson he learned how to hold the violin , the names of the strings, learned the quarter and half notes, learned the basics of how to hold the bow, and the parts that make up the violin . Alexander W. 1 Violin lesson David plunged right in to teach me, and adult beginner, the basics of playing the violin . He included guidance on holding the violin and bow, the mechanics of bowing, and had me playing some simple patterns on the violin . He even helped me fix a problem I had with my bow not tightening properly. He obviously is very well versed in techniques of teaching the violin . Michael P. 13 Violin lessons I had my first lesson with Rem and was really impressed with the depth of his mastership of violin , and pedagogical experience. I liked the way how tactful he was by providing his comments. He also demonstrated the excerpts from various pieces by playing them on his violin and on the piano, and they helped me to better understand his directions. As a violin student, I am very encouraged and have feeling I can quickly improve my violin skills with Rem as a tutor.

I have taught beginning, intermediate and advanced band and orchestra, in addition to choir and jazz band. I have been music director for over 10 middle school musicals. In my spare time I enjoy my two dogs, going horseback riding, and reading. *** Lesson Details *** I am very friendly, and encouraging to new students. I have a lot of patience for those who are new to the study of music. I can also be more demanding for those who have learned the basics and want to improve their playing. I am a proponent of teaching the basics of music reading and common musical terms. I can teach music through a variety of curricula, and will work with my students to choose a method that best suits their goals. I have a large music studio in my home that has a separate entrance,which is conducive to music making (with it's own bathroom). I accept students 8 years of age and older. *** Studio Equipment *** Has a keyboard, but no drum set *** Travel Equipment *** I prefer to teach in my home studio. *** Specialties *** I have been teaching band, orchestra & choir in public schools for 30+ years.

This may take a few lessons. Placing the left hand fingers is usually the last step before playing an A scale and then Twinkle.

Beginning students have to start from the bottom.

The technique is important but equally important is to develop the ability and taste of playing together right away. For this reason, regardless of the styles you want to deepen, I play as much as possible together with the student whether it is classical duets, folk songs or jazz. For the more advanced students a part of the study of the accompaniment is reserved as well as for soloists Calibrating the objectives based on the abilities of the age and the talent of the students is an attention that can avoid frustrations and lead everyone to the common goal of the musicians: to express and continuously improve.

A solid foundation is key. Without proper technique, you lack the ability to produce a pleasing sound. Advancing on the instrument will also be much more difficult. First, my students learn to hold the violin and bow properly, as well as resting and playing positions. If you'd like to follow a specified course of study, we begin the first steps of that method. Otherwise, we will follow the Suzuki method until the student reaches a level of expansion.

All students at CCM meet weekly with their private instructor for music class at our Santa Clara or Redwood City music studio. Our faculty takes into account the unique learning styles of each student, their musical background, age, and musical goals to create a clear plan and curriculum for the music students to follow. We strive to give beginning students a solid instrumental technique and a thorough understanding of music. Music lesson students who are beginners can expect to learn the fundamentals of note reading, rhythm, and technique while also exploring their own musical interests and basic repertoire. More intermediate and advanced students continue their technical and musical development through more ambitious repertoire. Many music students also participate in performances outside of CCM including regional, national, and international competitions, and adjudications such as the Royal Conservatory Music Development Program or ARBSM. Our school's goal is to spread a love and appreciation of music to students throughout the Bay Area. From San Mateo all the way to San Jose hundreds of music students have chosen The California Conservatory of Music for their guitar lessons, piano lessons, violin lessons, or voice lessons. If you or your child is interested in music lessons in Menlo Park, Belmont, San Carlos, Redwood Shores, Foster City, San Jose, Milpitas, or Sunnyvale, reach out to us at either our Redwood City or our Santa Clara CCM location!
