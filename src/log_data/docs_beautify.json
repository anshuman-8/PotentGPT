His salesman was a guy named Ron Ryan. My friend went in to lease a new G20 3-series and ended up choosing a car in his spec that he liked that had 97 miles on it (he didn't really realize that's kind of a lot for a brand new car lease). As he was pulling away, he realized there was an issue with the PDC system... he immediately told Salesman Ron, and Salesman Ron says that they would get it taken care of if he just scheduled an appointment. The next week, my friend took the car in for service, and the service center determined that the car had had a minor front impact that cracked one of the grilles and damaged one of the sensors. This wasn't something that was obvious and probably wouldn't have been noticed had the PDC not thrown an error. They tell him it's not covered under warranty, and he has to pay $2k+ to fix it. My friend contacts Salesman Ron and asks what the hell's going on. Salesman Ron says he \"doesn't remember promising to fix the PDC, sorry.\" So now my friend has been trying to get ahold of the GM to make this right, and the GM has been blatantly dodging him. He's always in a meeting and never calls back. My coworker went down to the dealership in person, and the GM was in a meeting... my friend waited 15 minutes, then went to check GM's status and was told \"he left for the day.\" This isn't the first time I've heard of a bad experience with BMW Stevens Creek. My wife bought her F30 328i from them in 2015, and as part of the deal they promised to touch up some bad paint chips in a few locations on the car. We agreed to the terms, signed the paperwork, and brought the car back the next week for paint touch-up, which we assumed would be done by the service center. We go to pick up the car only to find that the salesman himself touched up the paint... WITH THE WRONG COLOR. He said he knew that the color was wrong, but that he decided to touch it up anyway because he \"didn't want it to rust.\" This guy was a real genius, because these chips were on the PLASTIC BUMPERS. We're shopping for a new X5 right now, so I'm probably going to go down to Stevens Creek, find Ron Ryan, waste an hour or so of his time, and pull a \"Pretty Woman.\" / message IF statement for official threads IF statement for official threads controls if condition=\"THIS_SCRIPT == 'showthread'\" Appreciate 0 /if if condition=\"1!==1 AND <div class=\"bpVoters\"></div>\" div class=\"postBotBarItem\" script defer src=\"//platform.linkedin.com/in.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" script type=\"IN/Share\" data-counter=\"right\" /div left controls / controls post 25256590 popup menu acslater / post 25256590 popup menu / close content container / post #25256590 post #25257811 open content container this is not the last post shown on the page status icon and date img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"multisite-style/g20/statusicon/post_old.gif\" alt=\"Old\" border=\"0\" / 09-17-2019, 12:30 AM / status icon and date # 2 Second Lieutenant flags flags 100 Rep 275 Posts Drives: 2010 E92 M3 Join Date: Jan 2019 Location: Bay Area iTrader: ( ) IF statement for official threads message i have a really bad experience with them too, went there and get a lease deal on g20 m340i, the deal is good, but it tooks me a month to get all the things approved... and i still waiting for the mail from bmw fs.. won't suggest trusting that dealer at all / message IF statement for official threads IF statement for official threads controls if condition=\"THIS_SCRIPT == 'showthread'\" Appreciate 0 /if if condition=\"2!==1 AND <div class=\"bpVoters\"></div>\" left controls / controls post 25257811 popup menu cywing1119 / post 25257811 popup menu / close content container / post #25257811 post #25261754 open content container this is not the last post shown on the page status icon and date img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"multisite-style/g20/statusicon/post_old.gif\" alt=\"Old\" border=\"0\" / 09-17-2019, 10:22 PM / status icon and date # 3 Colonel flags flags 1691 Rep 2,699 Posts Drives: 23 X5MC Join Date: Sep 2018 Location: San Rafael CA iTrader: ( ) Garage List [0.00] IF statement for official threads message Wow that's messed up.

You're not going to have a much better time in Mountain View or the other luxury dealerships on Stevens Creek. There's just way too much young money in the area. You can't get decent service or a decent deal at these places at all. They can barely keep their cars in stock. That said, their service seemed to be OK.

Talking about class action lawsuits is a good way to inform someone that you're clueless about the legal process and guarantee that you won't get any cooperation without an attorney. Class actions consolidate multiple individual cases by individual plaintiffs who have similar claims against the same defendant (or group of defendants). Unless you can identify other buyers who have purchased \"new\" vehicles with undisclosed collision damage from the same dealer, there's no class action here. I would contact BMW NA. You could also complain to DMV, which licenses dealers, and the Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Automotive Repair. / message IF statement for official threads IF statement for official threads controls if condition=\"THIS_SCRIPT == 'showthread'\" Appreciate 4 /if if condition=\"11!==1 AND <div class=\"bpVoters\"><div useridval=\"78947\"><a href = \"/forums/member.php?u=78947\">claykin</a><span>1590.50</span></div><div useridval=\"461149\"><a href = \"/forums/member.php?u=461149\">Rossgazz</a><span>8.50</span></div><div useridval=\"243414\"><a href = \"/forums/member.php?u=243414\">Longdoggy</a><span>80.00</span></div><div useridval=\"249693\"><a href = \"/forums/member.php?u=249693\">NorCalAthlete</a><span>3195.00</span></div></div>\" 1590.50 8.50 80.00 3195.00 left controls / controls post 25497990 popup menu rlmesq / post 25497990 popup menu / close content container / post #25497990 post #25624222 open content container this is not the last post shown on the page status icon and date img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"multisite-style/g20/statusicon/post_old.gif\" alt=\"Old\" border=\"0\" / 12-30-2019, 01:07 PM / status icon and date # 12 Registered flags flags 0 Rep 3 Posts Drives: BMW 340i xDrive Join Date: Dec 2019 Location: Fremont, CA iTrader: ( ) Garage List [0.00] IF statement for official threads message Fingers crossed that I got a good deal, because I just closed a lease on a M340i xDrive. I've been searching and looking for 3 months and Stevens Creek was the best offer I got. It's valid to note that the car had 90 miles on it, probably this is why I got a good discount (11.5%). So far, all good.

I just bought my M340i yesterday from Stevens Creek and got a GREAT deal due to the COVID special and it being a retired loaner with 2K miles. $60k MSRP and got it for $48k. (tons of rebates and loyalty credit factored in too). Was treated well and also got my 430i from Stevens Creek as well. Maybe I had unique experiences, but I'm happy with them. / message IF statement for official threads IF statement for official threads controls if condition=\"THIS_SCRIPT == 'showthread'\" Appreciate 0 /if if condition=\"13!==1 AND <div class=\"bpVoters\"></div>\" left controls / controls post 26229271 popup menu ThreePac / post 26229271 popup menu / close content container / post #26229271 / start content table controls below postbits Post Reply / controls below postbits social bookmarking links Bookmarks / social bookmarking links lightbox scripts / lightbox scripts next / previous links \u00ab | \u00bb / next / previous links popup menu contents thread tools menu Thread Tools / thread tools menu **************************************************** thread search menu Search this Thread / thread search menu **************************************************** / popup menu contents forum rules and admin links Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts is On are On code is On HTML code is Off /forum rules and admin links All times are GMT -5.
