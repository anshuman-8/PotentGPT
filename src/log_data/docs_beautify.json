My way into the Maternity/ Newborn photography was paved by love, happiness and sheer coincidence. It was a chance encounter that made me realise the true calling of my passion. It was while clicking photographs of my newborn son Kiyan that I realised how I\u2019ve never been happier in my entire life. And I knew in that moment this is the sort of happiness I want to spread in this world, the kind of memories I want to create and sustain. And thats what I strive to do ever since. Having four years of experience in the field of maternity / newborn photography, I can say with that I\u2019m in love with my profession because it\u2019s impossible to not fall in love with the angels of God and newborn are truly the angels of this world. But you will never know how quick your angels will grow. Those tiny toes that now fit in to your palm will grow into feet that know its own way. Those \u201ctoothless smiles\u201d will make way for smiles, and those tiny palms that used to curl around your small finger will grow into palms that would hold you instead. Those tiny wonders now you hold in your hands will become grown up before you know it. so cherish that \u201ctoothless smiles\u201d while you can. Make Photographs because that\u2019s how you create, sustain memories. And I\u2019m here to help you freeze those moments in the best way possible. When your little angels grow up, give them these photographs. When you do that you are not only giving back them the memories but also their childhood and what else is sweeter in this whole world than one\u2019s own childhood! And don\u2019t forget photographs are the only memories that you can see. And I would love to help you see it ! Lots of Love, Midhu Sreenivas. Because, Moments Matter.

I didn't really have a plan aside exploring and taking lots of photos on my travels. After a couple of weeks settling into the Indian way of life in Bangalore (also known as Bengaluru) I decided to fly to Kochi. Kochi (also known as Cochin) is a coastal city in India\u2019s southwest state of Kerala. I always prefer being near the coast and the area had been recommended to me by both tourists and Indians alike. As a bonus, India\u2019s largest arts event was being held in the city whilst I would be there, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2018 (http://www.kochimuzirisbiennale.org) . I spent a few days on the mainland of Kochi in the Ernakulam area before moving to the coastal area of Fort Kochi. Whilst in Ernakulam I experienced one of the elephant festivals which are popular throughout the state of Kerala. The festivals contain a large number of decorated elephants (http://www.flickr.com/photos/geezaweezer/47950825488) , elephant handlers (http://www.flickr.com/photos/geezaweezer/47941936621) \ufeff, music and dance.

Fort Kochi is a fascinating area by the sea, rich in history and well known for its Portuguese, British and Dutch architecture. Another attraction of Fort Kochi are the large Chinese fishing nets positioned along the beach. The Nets look picture perfect on the right day but I didn\u2019t see a good sunset in the four days that I was staying there. I did however manage to capture some minimalist style silhouette photos above Kochi beach (https://www.geraintrowland.co.uk/blog/2019/5/26/sunset-silhouettes-in-kochi-india) one evening. As part of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale being held during my stay, there was an excellent photography workshop that I attended in the Jew Town area of Fort Kochi. The full day event was presented by Nick Ut (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Ut) And Mark Harris (https://www.markedwardharris.com) . This pair of world renowned photographers told us their incredible life stories and guided us with concepts, ideas and techniques to help guide our photographic goals. Both of the presenters were extremely helpful and motivational in their delivery. At the end of the event, inspired by the masters, I joined another photographer on the course to explore the area and take some photos. Sri Harsha Pamu (Instagram: shellzero) (https://www.instagram.com/shellzero/) from Hyderabad but now living and working in California is a big fan of street photography and made the visit to Kochi purely for the workshop. Fort Kochi is an excellent place for photography. It is a small area which can easily be explored on foot. We wandered around for a few hours following the coastline and explored the many streets and alleyways within the town. Due to the Biennale there was a lot of art work around which when combined with people can make for some interesting street photography (http://www.flickr.com/photos/geezaweezer/45771320274) . The area has some beautiful old buildings as well as an interesting mix of Churches, Temples, Mosques and a Synagogue. The small town is still a place of work for the people who live there so there is plenty of authentic photographic opportunities to capture. The people are also very friendly and open to having their picture taken (http://www.flickr.com/photos/geezaweezer/44666572080) . Click through the slideshow below to view some of my street photography and street portraits taken in Fort Kochi: Street Portrait taken with a Canon 50mm 1.4mm.

I enjoyed my time in Fort Kochi but it was time to move on so I took a taxi a couple of hours south to my next destination, Alappuzha (also known as Alleppey) in the south of Kerala. Alappuzha (or Alleppey) is a coastal city who\u2019s area is best known for it\u2019s rustic backwaters, a network of tranquil and picturesque lagoons and canals.
