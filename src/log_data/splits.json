major advisor about your study abroad plans. For some programs, such as UCEAP, you are required to meet with your major advisor as part of the application process. You may be able to fulfill many major requirements while abroad so it\u2019s recommended, and sometimes mandatory, to create an academic plan with your major advisor while applying for a particular study abroad program. While abroad , you may need to remain in contact with your major advisor for academic advising regarding specific courses. Be sure to keep all course descriptions and syllabi! When you return , see your major advisor as needed.

You may be subject-, technology- or career-driven to attend graduate school. The most important decision you will make is in the selection of your potential mentor. The BMCDB Graduate Group offers you the opportunity to rotate through 4 different labs in your first year to \u2018try out\u2019 potential advisors, mentoring styles, and labs. Finding a good match is made easier because of the large number of faculty within our group. You will have access to over 150 faculty members. Explore the BMCDB faculty (https://bmcdb.ucdavis.edu/faculty) webpage (https://bmcdb.ucdavis.edu/faculty) , to see the scope of research conducted in the group. Get to know the research of the faculty. For faculty that interest you, read one or two of their papers on the topic that you find interesting. Which of the faculty best fits with your interests and career goals? Think about questions you would ask the faculty that intrigue you. What is their mentoring philosophy? What is the culture of their lab? The possible career options ahead? These are questions you can ask directly once you have interacted with them. Contact the professor. Most professors like to hear from enthusiastic students who are interested in their field of study! But also be aware that faculty tend to be very busy, so be direct and concise with your communications.

Seek these out early. Give your letter writer at least 6 week\u2019s notice (no later than mid-October) and follow up 3, 2, and 1 week before the deadline. Your letter writer should be academically familiar with you and should be able to speak to your ability to complete a Ph.D. Cultivate a relationship with potential references early in your career. Aim to have all of your letters written by scientists willing to write strong letters; failing that, at least two of them should be. Ask him/her if they need pointers for the letter i.e. dates you interacted, quarter and year of the class you took, and your grade. For your internship advisor, you may include the specific dates you worked, duties, and accomplishments. Transcripts UC Davis requires academic records from each college-level institution you have attended. You will be instructed to upload scanned copies of your transcripts after you have submitted your online application.

UC Davis Graduate Studies is registered to receive IELTS Academic scores using the IELTS Results Service E-Delivery, so please send your scores to: University of California, Davis Graduate Studies Personal History and Statement of Purpose Each section of your SOP and personal history should be seamlessly interconnected to form a continuous narrative. Invest a significant amount of time writing each, developing it through several iterations. Ask your professors for feedback on your writing. Some elements of the SOP may overlap with the personal history; for example, both may include obstacles to academic progress such as illness, working full-time, etc. Two important pieces of advice: (i) Be honest: do not try to reinvent yourself or inflate the importance of your accomplishments. (ii) Be specific: avoid platitudes and give examples. Show how you have turned a negative into a positive or how it now becomes a driving force for you to be a scientist. Drafting your Statement of Purpose This allows you to tell the Admissions Committee directly, why you should be admitted to the program. It should be concise (500-1000 words; max 4000 characters), informative and well-organized, and present yourself as someone who can successfully complete the graduate program. Give yourself ample time to write your SOP. The Admissions committee can easily spot hurried and poorly thought out writing and this will have a negative effect on your evaluation. Secondly, your statement should be specific to BMCDB. Generic letters used to apply to multiple institutions where faculty or school names are simply interchanged can be detected.

There are several online resources available to help you, but here are few tips: Be clear on why are you applying to the BMCDB Graduate Group Provide a context for your personal motivation i.e. state how you became interested in a particular topic and why you wish to pursue this question in the BMCDB Graduate Group. This should be brief but well thought-through. Describe your past academic and research experiences State succinctly, the importance of the research question, the specific objective of your project, your general approach, and the significance of your results. Discuss your current research interests Describe how your classwork and research experience (described above) converge to make you a good candidate for your field of study in BMCDB. Some students wish to continue in the same research vein, while others, may wish to switch fields, or approaches. It is suggested that you identify multiple faculty members you would like to work with including a clear justification for such. In this segment, the Admissions Committee will be able to assess your depth of understanding of the field.

Give examples of leadership, service, teaching and tutoring during your academic career. List any successes you achieved and what you learned from them. Curriculum Vitae/Resume Please upload your current curriculum vitae or resume when prompted to do so by the online application. Application Review Your application will be evaluated by a committee of faculty from the BMCDB Graduate Group. The Admissions Committee evaluates applicants using a Holistic review, here are a few things that the Admissions Committee consider when assessing your application: Your undergraduate and graduate GPA Rarely will you be accepted into BMCDB with a GPA of less than 3.0, and the average is higher than this. Good grades in upper division courses and subjects related to the graduate program of interest are more important than those in other subjects. Extenuating circumstances that affected your overall GPA can be outlined in your Personal History. Research experience Almost all successful applicants have laboratory experience prior to applying to graduate school. Working independently on a discrete research question is ideal. You should be knowledgeable about the research you conducted, the hypothesis tested and the rationale for the approach taken. This is better than simply being familiar with lab techniques. Recommendations made by your references Seek individuals who can comment on your research such as a Research supervisor (preferred) and academic ability"}, {"metadata": "https://bmcdb.ucdavis.edu/apply", "content": "approach taken. This is better than simply being familiar with lab techniques. Recommendations made by your references Seek individuals who can comment on your research such as a Research supervisor (preferred) and academic ability e.g. a course Professor, in the letter of recommendation (LOR). Evidence of publication and presentation of your research data This would enhance your application but will not be a decisive factor in acceptance. If you are currently in the final year of your undergraduate degree, look for all opportunities to present and publish your work. Your academic and professional goals This can sometimes indicate if you have the \u2018right\u2019 motivation for graduate school, are realistic in what can be accomplished, and if the BMCDB Graduate Group is the right fit for you. Evidence of active participation in lab meetings and graduate level seminar courses This may be highlighted in your statement of purpose, or by your Professor in one of the LOR. Your ability to write Your statement of purpose and personal history may convey this, but comments from your Recommender may also be helpful. Good academic grades and solid research experience are the most important, as they may indicate your scholastic aptitude and potential for scientific research, but the BMCDB Admissions Committee will consider all the parts of your application in making a decision. Scores on standardized tests are not definitive: do not obsess over your scores. Your personal statement and the letters of recommendations are extremely important to the Admissions Committee, as they communicate who you are as a potential student, so pay attention to these. In exceptional cases, lower grades and scores may be offset with extensive research experience especially in an area that a faculty member may value. Still, research experience is not an automatic substitute for poor grades. The BMCDB program of study is broad and rigorous. We need evidence that you will be able to thrive in that environment.
