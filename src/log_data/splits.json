Top tips for renting a car in Kerala Unlike most places, Kerala is one of the few states where you can request a car rental driver, especially if you're new to India. But many renters prefer to drive their own car. Renting a car with a driver offers the flexibility of being picked up from your address and getting dropped at your destination, like the airport, at no extra cost. A driver who knows the locality can explain some local topics and experiences. You won't be charged extra, but you may give a tip. Note that a car rental driver is not your guide. They only help with general questions but cannot accompany you inside the attractions. Companies offering Kerala car rentals are found near airports such as Cochin International Airport and major cities like Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, and Thrissur. Rental vehicles are distinguished by black number plates with yellow letters. In case of an unexpected incident, call the"}, {"metadata": "https://www.kayak.com/Kerala-India-Car-Rentals.1608.crr.html", "content": "Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, and Thrissur. Rental vehicles are distinguished by black number plates with yellow letters. In case of an unexpected incident, call the rental office and the police immediately, and secure the vehicle if you can. Remember to note down the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of people involved, including a witness. You will need these details to compose the accident report. The car rental period in Kerala is extendable but at most 30 days (for most car rental agencies). Inform the car rental representatives at least three hours before the stipulated drop-off time or as indicated on the rental agreement if you want to keep the car for more hours or days. Note that the extension is not guaranteed and depends on availability. Always return your car on time; otherwise, you will be penalized for every day you defaulted. With Kerala car rentals, you have to follow specific rules, but they differ from one company to the next. For instance, you cannot use the car for pacemaking, racing, towing, and teaching another person to drive. Do not exceed the manufacturer's recommended maximum weight when loading the trunk and secure the luggage safely. You must seek written consent at the rental office if you need to go outside Kerala. Crossing a state border can be costly because the rental agency has to pay taxes. Before you drive off, check whether the price quoted allows interstate driving. 25% of our users found rental cars in Kerala for $40 or less Book your rental car in Kerala at least 1 day before your trip in order to get a below-average price Compact rental cars in Kerala are around -34% cheaper than other car types, on average FAQs about renting a car in Kerala How much does it cost to rent a car in Kerala?

While the legal age for driving in Kerala is 18, you must be at least 21 to rent a car. Present your original ID, driving license, and proof of address at the car rental counter. Foreigners can use their original passports as IDs. Your driving permit must be for a 4-wheeler, typically known as an LMV-NT license (Light Motor Vehicle, Non-Transport) recognized for personal use only. If you book a commercial vehicle like a van or truck, ensure you have a TR (Transport, Commercial) license. You should have a minimum driving experience of 12 months. Most car rental companies do not take cash, so you need a credit or debit card. They may accept Internet banking and mobile payments.

Good one Reply reply Highwayman125 (/user/Highwayman125/) \u2022 ?lit$746959067$ 1 yr. ago As others have suggested , better not drive here if you are used to driving in the west. There is a steep learning curve to drive on Kerala roads. My brother who learnt driving in the UK , had a horrid time driving on our roads. He used to drive only in town areas , never drove the car out on the highways and still had a few close shaves with the bikers. The worst part is , if you get into even some minor accidents and the other party files a case , it will also delay your travel back to the US. You need to ask yourself whether it's worth taking such a risk. Instead of a monthly car rental , for similar or a bit higher cost , you can negotiate with a local tour operator for a 1 month rental with a driver. It won't cost you a lot more than renting a car. Not only will it be safer , the driver can also help you out with local places etc. You have also mentioned that you got a manual car at home , you do have an option to hire a driver. They typically charge around thousand rupees a day . Ask around and your local friends or relatives will know somehow who does this for a living . I'm from Thrissur.

Reply reply Appropriate-Emu4576 (/user/Appropriate-Emu4576/) \u2022 ?lit$746959067$ 1 yr. ago Don't drive if you can help it. I used to drive manual in Kerala. But since I am used to driving in US it is difficult to do it here. I gave up after nearly causing an accident. Kerala also has very strict traffic rules. I get a driver or get a relative to help out every time I visit. Reply reply dragonwarrior_1 (/user/dragonwarrior_1/) \u2022 ?lit$746959067$ 1 yr. ago Kerala has very strict traffic rules. Lol.
