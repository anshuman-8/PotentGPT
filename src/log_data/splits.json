It may not seem like much yet, but the number of job postings related to A.I. accounted for 5.3% of total jobs in the information sector in 2022, according to data from market research firm Lightcast. Plus, job postings in industries not traditionally affiliated with tech, such as real estate, are also seeing an uptick in demand for A.I. skills among candidates. But only about one-in-10 workers across the globe has the educational or professional background to fill jobs requiring A.I. skills, according to a recent report (https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/digital-skills-based-experience/) by tech giant Salesforce (https://fortune.com/company/salesforce-com/fortune500/) . In an effort to meet industry demand, more and more universities now offer degree programs focused on artificial intelligence. Namely, the University of Texas\u2014Austin (https://fortune.com/education/bootcamps/university-of-texas-austin/) , which Fortune ranks as having top tech bootcamps and MBA programs (https://fortune.com/education/business/university-of-texas-austin-mccombs/) , announced the launch of its master\u2019s degree program in A.I. in January. \u201cThe fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning have seen unprecedented growth over the last 10 years,\u201d Adam Klivans, a professor of computer science (https://fortune.com/education/information-technology/best-online-masters-in-computer-science/) and director of the Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning (IFML) at UT\u2014Austin, said in a statement announcing the new program. \u201cOur goal is to ensure that every qualified student can access a premier education in A.I., one that is keeping pace with this rapidly evolving field.\u201d While"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://fortune.com/education/articles/looking-to-break-into-a-i-these-3-top-schools-offer-masters-in-artificial-intelligence-programs/", "source": ["google"], "title": "Looking to break into A.I.?

Fortune compiled a list of three master\u2019s in A.I. programs to check out if you\u2019re looking to make a career switch. Each of these schools offer other master\u2019s degree programs that Fortune has ranked among the best\u2014including top MBA programs (https://fortune.com/education/business/best-mba-programs/) . 1. University of Texas\u2014Austin UT\u2014Austin offers its online master\u2019s program in A.I.

The degree covers about two years worth of content. The program is offered on edX, an online education platform, and costs $10,000 to complete, making it one of the more affordable options. The degree covers A.I.-related topics, including natural language processing, reinforcement learning, computer vision, and deep learning, which prepares graduates for A.I. jobs in engineering, research and development, product management, and consulting. The program quickly skyrocketed in popularity (https://fortune.com/education/articles/ut-austin-is-launching-a-new-online-masters-degree-program-in-a-i/) , with more than 4,000 prospective students requesting more information from the university within 24 hours of its launch announcement. Applications for the first cohort open on June 1 and are due by Sept. 15, with an Aug. 15 priority deadline. Prospective students must submit an application (https://www.applytexas.org/) to the Graduate School at The University of Texas at Austin as well as a statement of purpose, resume, and transcripts.

GRE scores aren\u2019t required to apply, but most admitted students have at least a 3.0 undergraduate GPA. While the per-course tuition in the engineering school is $6,290, Dean\u2019s support (financial aid) typically brings the cost down to $5,090 for graduate-level courses. This brings the estimated total cost of the online program to $50,900. 3.

Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence degrees provide in-depth theoretical and practical knowledge in artificial intelligence topics. Most students in these programs have a strong background in computer science and mathematics. Many also have work experience or at least a strong interest in the artificial intelligence specialty in computer science. To demonstrate mastery of artificial intelligence, students complete coursework in introductory and advanced artificial intelligence topics, algorithm design and analysis, and artificial intelligence learning methods such as natural language processing, deep learning, and reinforced learning. Students develop skills in creating and training agents to make decisions and perform on those decisions. Learned skills also include how machines interact with humans. Industry-leading technology companies increasingly require master\u2019s degrees in artificial intelligence for their more highly skilled, and therefore more highly compensated, positions. These positions include Principal or Senior Data Scientists, Artificial Intelligence Neural Design Researcher, and Machine Learning Engineer. Types of Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence Degrees Universities call their Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence programs different titles. Most universities with a graduate-level artificial intelligence program offer standalone Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence degrees, such as the University of Michigan Dearborn (https://umdearborn.edu/cecs/departments/computer-and-information-science/graduate-programs/ms-artificial-intelligence) , Northwestern (https://degree.msai.northwestern.edu/prospect/rqst-prog-guide/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=msai-program-guide&utm_content=leads-search_graduate) , and Johns Hopkins (https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence/masters-degree-requirements/) . Other universities add artificial intelligence as a specialization or concentration for a Master\u2019s of Computer Science. For"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://www.mastersinai.org/degrees/best-masters-in-artificial-intelligence/", "source": ["google"], "title": "17 Best Master's in AI Programs - MastersInAI.org"}, "content": "and Johns Hopkins (https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence/masters-degree-requirements/) . Other universities add artificial intelligence as a specialization or concentration for a Master\u2019s of Computer Science. For example, artificial intelligence is one of 11 specializations for Georgia Tech\u2019s Master\u2019s of Computer Science. (https://www.cc.gatech.edu/ms-computer-science-specializations) Many in the industry consider related degrees similar to a Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence. For example, a Master\u2019s in Data Science from Syracuse (https://requestinfo.onlinegrad.syracuse.edu/mids8-d.html) and a Master\u2019s of Intelligence in Intelligent Robotic Systems from Kennesaw (https://find.kennesaw.edu/master-degrees/robotics/) would provide a sufficient mastery of artificial intelligence materials. How Do Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence Programs Work? Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence programs are similar to most other master\u2019s programs for the number of courses required and time required to complete the program. Most require 10 courses and take 12 months to 24 months to complete. Some programs are more structured, with new students starting in certain semesters like fall and spring. Other programs allow enrollment on a rolling basis. Skills You\u2019ll Gain in an AI Program To graduate with a Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence degree, you must demonstrate both theoretical and practical skills in artificial intelligence. You will graduate with a portfolio of projects completed with these skills. Artificial intelligence requires excellent algorithm design, coding, and data analysis. Broadly, a Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence enables you to produce applications capable of autonomous decision-making. Some concentrations and courses focus on specific applications in artificial intelligence, such as robotics, financial technology, and eCommerce. For example, Northeastern (https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-artificial-intelligence-17839/) expects you to develop skills in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. Graduate AI Curriculum A Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence usually has one to four required courses focusing on artificial intelligence, statistical analysis, and software development. The additional courses are graduate-level computer science courses. Typically, only one or two may be unrelated to artificial intelligence. Because artificial intelligence requires the sophisticated application of complex concepts to advanced problems, most programs require either a thesis or a capstone project. Many programs, like Carnegie Mellon (https://msaii.cs.cmu.edu/) , require students to work in teams on this project. Universities typically allow students to choose between the thesis or capstone project. Some universities offer more unique options. For example, Northwestern\u2019s program (https://degree.msai.northwestern.edu/prospect/rqst-prog-guide/) has two tracks: a traditional, 15-month track and a 12-month program that combines a capstone project and an internship with industry partners. Boston (https://www.bu.edu/cs/masters/program/ai/) is also unique because it only requires eight courses and can be completed in just two semesters. Master\u2019s in AI Admissions and Requirements Skills and Prerequisites Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence programs require applicants to have completed several courses fundamental to artificial intelligence. For example, Johns Hopkins (https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence/masters-degree-requirements/) has the following prerequisites: three semesters of calculus, one semester of linear algebra, one semester of probability and statistics, a semester of fundamental programming, and a semester of advanced programming concepts. The specific programming language is usually not specified, but students may find more success in the program if they know Java and Python. Accredited computer science programs have the prerequisite courses as requirements to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. Other STEM degrees may also require them, but you may need to complete prerequisite courses prior to applying for a master\u2019s in artificial intelligence. Admissions Requirements Most universities require a strong GPA in a STEM-related degree and at least a 2.75 or 3.0 GPA. Computer Science and Statistics bachelor\u2019s degrees are preferred, but not necessarily required. Most programs do not require a GRE test score. However, San Diego (https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/masters-applied-artificial-intelligence/apply/) allows a GPA below 2.75 with a strong GRE score. Moreover, many Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence programs require a statement of interest explaining why you are applying to the program and any specialized experience relevant to the degree. The statement of interest is your opportunity to show you are qualified for"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://www.mastersinai.org/degrees/best-masters-in-artificial-intelligence/", "source": ["google"], "title": "17 Best Master's in AI Programs - MastersInAI.org"}, "content": "strong GRE score. Moreover, many Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence programs require a statement of interest explaining why you are applying to the program and any specialized experience relevant to the degree. The statement of interest is your opportunity to show you are qualified for the program. The Role of Ethics in AI Degree Programs Ethics is important to artificial intelligence programs because artificial intelligence deeply affects society in several ways. First, artificial intelligence could lead to data security and privacy violations. Artificial intelligence is used to automatically collect data about people, perhaps without their knowledge or permission. Second, artificial intelligence sometimes involves inherent biases and discrimination. The applications analyze data and develop models based on the data. If the data is biased, then the artificial intelligence program will discriminate based on the bias. For example, automatic sentencing applications are often biased because the historical data for prison sentences is biased against persons of color. Third, artificial intelligence has proven capable of deeply influencing the population at large. For example, search results that are tailored to a user\u2019s search history and other online data will result in them only reconfirming their biases, and ultimately progressing to an extreme view. If their initial impressions are wrong, they will continue to reaffirm those incorrect views because their search results will never return an alternative perspective. How to Find the Best AI Program For Your Needs The best Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence program for you depends on several factors. You should consider not only the strength of the program but also how it fits into your goals for earning the degree. There are so many Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence programs available, you should be able to find one that meets your needs. In fact, you might be overwhelmed with how many options you have. Great Artificial Intelligence programs offer the courses you want to take on a schedule that meets your needs. For example, if you need to work full-time while completing the degree, the best program allows for flexibility in the curriculum for when to take the courses. Moreover, great programs meet your budget. Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence range from affordable to expensive. Try to find out where the programs\u2019 graduates land after graduation to see if earning the degree at that university will enable you to accomplish your ultimate goals with the degree. Avoid simply choosing the highest \u201cranked\u201d program or the program that is easiest. Also, try not to make a hasty decision just based on the university\u2019s website. Your choice should be based on a more complex analysis with sufficient research that includes a visit to campus, conversations with current students and alumni, and discussion with your family if they will be impacted by your pursuit of the degree. Why are You Pursuing a Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence Degree? When deciding which university to attend, start by laying out the skills you want to learn and the goals you want to accomplish by earning a Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence. It is quite likely that the personal statement you are required to submit with your application expects you to answer this in a formal essay. For example, San Diego (https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/masters-applied-artificial-intelligence/apply/) requires a detailed personal statement. San Diego has a series of questions for you to answer, such as what interests you in artificial intelligence, your career goals, and what interests you about their program in particular. Take your time on this essay, because it establishes a baseline for identifying the right program for you. Consider Program Location and Delivery Format Once you establish your goals, consider more practical aspects, such as the location and format of the program. Some programs are offered exclusively online, like Johns Hopkins (https://ep.jhu.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence/masters-degree-requirements/) , whereas others require on-campus courses, like Northwestern (https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/artificial-intelligence/) . If you want to move to a new city, using a Master\u2019s of Artificial Intelligence program would be one option for establishing roots. However, if you are tied to your location, you may need an online or local program. Costs of Master\u2019s in Artificial Intelligence Programs Another important consideration is the cost of the degree. Tuition ranges from around $10,000 to $80,000 or more. For example, Kennesaw (https://find.kennesaw.edu/master-degrees/robotics/) is on the lower end of cost for tuition. Although many engineers that work in artificial intelligence who have master\u2019s degrees earn over $100,000 per year, not all manage to land a job paying that well. When you consider how you will pay tuition, try not to rely on future income. Instead, be realistic about how you will pay, whether it is loans, working while taking classes, or otherwise. Note that some programs, like Syracuse"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://www.mastersinai.org/degrees/best-masters-in-artificial-intelligence/", "source": ["google"], "title": "17 Best Master's in AI Programs - MastersInAI.org"}, "content": "that well. When you consider how you will pay tuition, try not to rely on future income. Instead, be realistic about how you will pay, whether it is loans, working while taking classes, or otherwise. Note that some programs, like Syracuse (https://requestinfo.onlinegrad.syracuse.edu/mids8-d.html) , require a full-time internship, which would make working another full-time job impossible. Other programs, such as Northeastern (https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/master-of-science-in-artificial-intelligence-17839/) , allow for more flexible, part-time commitments. These also work well when you need a better work-life balance due to family or other commitments.

As AI plays an increasingly important role in society, it is critical to understand both the ethical factors that influence the design of AI and the ethical dimensions of the impacts of AI in society. The goal of this course is to prepare AI professionals for the important ethical responsibilities that come with developing systems that may have consequential, even life-and-death, consequences. Students first learn about both the history of ethics and the history of AI, to understand the basis for contemporary, global ethical perspectives (including non-Western and feminist perspectives) and the factors that have influenced the design, development, and deployment of AI-based systems. Students then explore the societal dimensions of the ethics and values of AI. Finally, students explore the technical dimensions of the ethics and values of AI, including design considerations such as fairness, accountability, transparency, power, and agency.

Program The Artificial Intelligence master's degree program is designed as a 30-credit hour curriculum that give students a comprehensive framework for artificial intelligence with one of 4 concentration areas: (1) Computer Vision, (2) Intelligent Interaction, (3) Machine Learning, and (4) Knowledge Management and Reasoning. Students will engage in an extensive core intended curriculum to develop depth in all the core concepts that build a foundation for artificial intelligence theory and practice. Also, they will be given the opportunity to build on the core knowledge of AI by taking a variety of elective courses selected from colleges throughout campus to explore key contextual areas or more complex technical AI applications. The program will be accessible to both full-time and part-time students, aiming to train students who aspire to have AI research and development (R&D) or leadership careers in industry. To accommodate the needs of working professionals who might be interested in this degree program, the course offerings for the MS in AI will be in the late afternoon and evening hours to allow students to earn the degree through part-time study. The program may be completed entirely on campus, entirely online, or through a combination of on-campus and online courses.

Master of Science in Artificial Inteligence (AI) and Business Analystics in the Fall of 2024, prepares students for growing needs in industry for expertise in business analytics, data science, data engineering, and information technology across a wide range of sectors including technology, banking, healthcare, consulting, energy, retail, entertainment, telecom, and many others. Our graduates secure internships and jobs in companies such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Adobe, Tesla, Samsung, McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, Cap Gemini, Booz & Company, Deloitte, Citi, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Capital One, SAS Institute, Amgen, Verizon, Disney, Paypal, TechData, Raymond James Financial, Quicken Loans, Publix, and Spectrum Brands. Starting salaries of our graduates are typically in the $100,000-125,000 range, with higher salaries for jobs on the West Coast. We offer a strong industry-relevant curriculum emphasizing technology skills such as business analytics, machine/deep learning, SQL and NoSQL databases, agile methods, coding and scripting, networks and security, cloud computing, and big data. An advisory board consisting of senior business leaders and information systems executives works closely with the department to ensure that the program stays relevant and maintains high standards. Classes in the program are taught by a world-class faculty with PhD degrees from Harvard Business School, Princeton University, Northwestern University, University of Chicago, University of Maryland, University of Texas at Austin, Purdue University, University of Michigan, New York University, University of Pennsylvania, Indiana University, Georgia Tech, University of Arizona, and many others. Students have the option of working in full-time or part-time internships and customized independent study opportunities with professors as part of the program. The program also offers a suite of extra-curricular activities to complement our curriculum and to help our students improve their technology skills, internship and job placement potential, and career success. These activities include free technology bootcamps, certification programs, resume workshops, LinkedIn workshops, interview workshops, career fairs, and many others. Outstanding students will also have the opportunity to participate in practice center projects (mentored internships managed by the department) and get employment opportunities as teaching assistants or graduate research assistants throughout USF campus. ADMISSIONS Admission to our program is extremely competitive. For the 2022 academic year, we received over 3,000 applications and admitted only 300 students. Although we admit students in Fall and Spring semesters, most or all of our seats are often filled in the Fall semester. We evaluate applications on a rolling basis and close the process when our student intake capacity is reached. Hence, interested international applicants are advised to apply early for the Fall semester because there is no guarantee that"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://www.usf.edu/business/graduate/ms-bais/", "source": ["google"], "title": "MS in Business Analytics / Information Systems (MS/BAIS) | USF ..."}, "content": "of our seats are often filled in the Fall semester. We evaluate applications on a rolling basis and close the process when our student intake capacity is reached. Hence, interested international applicants are advised to apply early for the Fall semester because there is no guarantee that there will be seats available in Spring. Spring applicants may request that they be considered for Fall admission if no seats are available for Spring. For the Fall semester , the early deadline for application is March 1 for international students and July 1 for domestic students. You may continue to apply after that and consideration may be given depending on the availability of seats. For international applicants, we try to make our final admission decisions by April to give them sufficient time to get visa appointments at their local U.S. consulate or embassy. For the Spring semester , our application deadline is August 1 for international students and November 1 for domestic students. However, we admit most applicants in the Fall, and the number of applicants we admit in the Spring is in general very limited. Our admission decisions are based on a \u201cportfolio criteria\u201d that includes the following components. Please note that incomplete applications (e.g., missing GRE scores, unless explicitly waived by us) will NOT be processed, until they are completed: Fully completed application, including payment of application fee We do not entertain requests for application fee waivers. A four-year bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited university We prefer applicants with technology majors such as computer science, engineering, etc., though we may also consider non-technology majors if they have demonstrated solid technology skills or have technology-focused work experience. Applicants with a 3-year bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited institution must also meet the following requirements: (1) Minimum GMAT score of 650 or a minimum GRE score of 321 (combined verbal and quantitative), with a minimum of 25th percentile in the verbal portion of the test, and (2) if the 3-year bachelor\u2019s degree is less than 120 hours from Non-Bologna Accord Institutions, a transcript evaluation from a NACES member is required to confirm equivalency. GMAT or GRE scores We strongly encourage in-center GRE/GMAT tests and discourage at-home or online tests. The GRE/GMAT requirement may be waived for applicants with 3 years or more of relevant full-time work experience in information technology, information systems, or business analytics in the United States. Working in a foreign country for a U.S. client will NOT qualify for this waiver. Applicants with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology, information systems, or business analytics from USF or equivalent U.S. universities with a GPA of 3.5 or higher may also request a waiver of the GRE/GMAT exam. Applicants requesting such waivers should provide appropriate documentation justifying such waivers based on the above criteria. Waiver requests will be evaluated on a case by case basis. International applicants are NOT eligible for GRE/GMAT waiver irrespective of length of work experience. Relevant work experience in information technology, information services, business analytics, or related sectors. This is a very important component of our admissions criteria. We will consider students with extensive industry experience, even if they have less than desired GMAT or GRE scores. Two letters of recommendations. A completed information form that we will send out upon receipt of your application. In addition, all applicants must meet USF\u2019s Admission and English Proficiency requirements. For international applicants, this means TOEFL scores, although we do not consider TOEFL score as part of our admission criteria. Admission Process We get several thousands of applications, which are first reviewed by our Office of Graduate Admissions and then by our MS-BAIS program on a first come, first served basis. The admission decision usually takes 1.5 to 2 months, and visas for international students may take an additional 3 to 4 months, depending on appointment availability at your local consulate. Our admission decisions are first come, first served, and will close whenever we reach our intake capacity for the academic year. Our admissions process is as follows: 1. Examine our application criteria above to determine your suitability for our MS-BAIS program. If you wish to apply, submit your application, complete with GRE/GMAT scores, college transcripts, and other necessary details to USF Office of Graduate Admissions using our online portal. NOTE: If you want to apply and do not see MS Business Analytics and Information Systems in the drop-down of available programs, please look for MS Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Analytics. 2. The Graduate Admissions Office will notify you the receipt of your application, assign you a U number, review your application and supporting documentation, and if complete, will refer your application to the MS-BAIS program. This process may take up to one month, depending on their workload. 3. If your application is incomplete (e.g., missing"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://www.usf.edu/business/graduate/ms-bais/", "source": ["google"], "title": "MS in Business Analytics / Information Systems (MS/BAIS) | USF ..."}, "content": "review your application and supporting documentation, and if complete, will refer your application to the MS-BAIS program. This process may take up to one month, depending on their workload. 3. If your application is incomplete (e.g., missing TOEFL score, missing application fee, etc.), it will not be processed beyond this stage. Please check our online portal to see what is missing from your application. You can also contact the Graduate Admissions Office at 813-974-3350 or GradAdmissions@usf.edu (not the MS-BAIS program director) for further help in this regard. 4. If your application is forwarded to the MS-BAIS program, we will notify you by e-mail our receipt of your application and ask you to provide additional supplemental information via an online form. If you did not receive this e-mail, your application is likely still pending at our Graduate Admissions Office; contact them for the status of your application. 5. The MS-BAIS program will review your complete application and notify you the final decision on your application. Expect this process to take another 15-20 days. This is the end of the admissions process, but you still have a long way to go to join our program. 6. International students will now have to provide proof of funds for our Office of International Students to issue you an I-20. This may require a bank statement or a bank loan. Domestic students may skip to Step 8. 7. After receiving your I-20, schedule a visa appointment at your nearest US consulate or embassy. Depending on applicant volume, it may take months to get a visa appointment. If you don\u2019t get your visa appointment in a timely manner, you may have to defer your joining date to the following semester. Let us know if you choose to defer. If you change your mind and want to join another university, you will have to restart your I-20 process with your new university and get a new visa, which may further delay your arrival to the USA by several more months. 8. Inform us via e-mail when your visa is approved, so that we can register you for classes for your first semester. Your first semester classes are Machine Learning (using Python), Analytical Methods in Business (using R), and Advanced Database Management Systems, if you meet program prerequisites. Students not meeting prerequisites will have to take remedial classes first, which may delay their graduation from the program. 9. Plan to arrive to our campus at least one week before the start of the semester. This is the time when we do orientation sessions and conduct free workshops (bootcamps) on R and Python \u2013 the two programming languages you must know for your first day of class. If you miss these bootcamps, it will be your responsibility to learn these tools on your own. Our professors don\u2019t teach programming in class; they assume that you attended the bootcamps, are conversant in these tools, and are ready to use them to build statistical models and machine learning models in your first semester. This extra week will also help you find an apartment to stay, which are quite difficult to get at the start of any semester. 10. Upon arrival to the USF, apply for a USF ID card and NetID. NetID is your single sign on (SSO) access for USF computer systems, including our library, Canvas learning management system (which hosts all our class information), Oasis course registration system, Banner grade system, and many others. Costs Florida has one of the lowest tuition costs of all states in the United States. Our tuition and fees can be calculated using our online tuition calculator at http://usfweb.usf.edu/graduate-studies/tuition-and-fee-calculator/ (enter \u2018Graduate (Business, Engineering)\u2019 in the Program Level drop down menu; the MS-BAIS program is a minimum of 33 credits, not including any outstanding prerequisites). As of 2022, the out-of-state tuition and fees for a two-year MS-BAIS degree for an international student is approximately $30,000. Students should also include another $15,000-20,000 for two years of living expenses while in the program. Graduate Assistantships We have a limited number of graduate (teaching) assistantships, which typically make students eligible for a lower, in-state tuition and pays for their health insurance during their term of assistantship, in addition to providing them a monthly stipend. Assistantship decisions are highly competitive and made on a semester-to-semester basis, based on students\u2019 performance in prior semesters at USF, their work ethic, and their ability to assist us with undergraduate and graduate classes. For example, we will only hire students with a strong background in statistics as teaching"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://www.usf.edu/business/graduate/ms-bais/", "source": ["google"], "title": "MS in Business Analytics / Information Systems (MS/BAIS) | USF ..."}, "content": "basis, based on students\u2019 performance in prior semesters at USF, their work ethic, and their ability to assist us with undergraduate and graduate classes. For example, we will only hire students with a strong background in statistics as teaching assistants for our statistics classes. Assistantships are not available in your first semester at USF, but will be available from the second semester onwards, based on your performance in prior semesters at USF. Note that assistantships are not merit-based or need-based scholarships, they are on-campus jobs, for which you are expected to work for 20 hours/week as assigned by your supervising professor. Additional on-campus job opportunities are available as graduate assistants in other offices, departments, and centers on the USF campus, for example, at our Dean\u2019s office, the Provost\u2019s office, at USF Library, our INTO program office, USF Morsani Center of Medicine, USF Center for Urban Transportation Research, and other departments on campus. These jobs typically require specific skills such as Power BI, coding, and so forth. These are university-wide positions, and students are selected based on their fit with job requirements. Our students are often considered favorably for these positions because of their strong technical skills. Only students already enrolled at USF have access to such positions on an internal USF portal. Incoming international students cannot apply for these jobs from their home countries. Students can also do paid full-time or part-time internships at a US company for a maximum of 12 months as part of the curricular practical training (CPT) option of the program, while fully retaining their 18-month optional practical training (OPT) to secure a job and a work visa upon completion of their MS-BAIS degree. You must complete two semesters of coursework at USF to be eligible for an internship. Our students often get internship positions in prestigious companies like Amazon, BMW, and JP Morgan Chase, and many of these internships often convert into full-time positions upon graduation. CURRICULUM The Master of Science in Business Analytics & Information Systems (Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Analytics) requires 33 hours of coursework, plus any necessary prerequisite courses, and may be taken either full-time or part-time. This includes 15 credit hours of required courses (core courses and capstone) and 18 credit hours of electives. Typically, most courses are 3 credit hours. Full-time students with appropriate prerequisites may be able to complete the major in 3-4 semesters of study. Part-time students will typically need from 2-3 years to complete the degree. Optionally, students can choose one of three possible concentrations\u2014analytics and business intelligence, Fintech, and information assurance\u2014by choosing a certain set of elective courses recommended for each concentration. The required courses are the same for each concentration. However, a concentration is not necessary to complete your degree. For details about our required classes, electives, and prerequisites, please refer to our catalog (https://usf.edu/grad-catalog-business-analytics-and-information-systems-ms) . For more information on our coursework or prerequisite requirements, feel free to contact the program advisor below. Global executive Program This Global Executive Master of Science in Business Analytics & Information Systems program (/business/graduate/ms-bais-global/index.aspx) is designed for full-time, working professionals worldwide. This is a fully online program with 100% live instruction that combines information systems and business analytics courses. This program offers a predetermined set of required and elective courses in a lockstep format, without the flexibility or customizability of our regular program. Since students in this executive program are already full-time working professionals, our extracurricular support (bootcamps, internships, job placement, etc.) are not available to students in this program.

In form and in content, this coming semester will be like no other. We will live differently, work differently and learn differently. But in its very difference rests its enormous power. The mission of Yeshiva University is to enrich the moral, intellectual and spiritual development of each of our students, empowering them with the knowledge and abilities to become people of impact and leaders of tomorrow. Next year\u2019s studies will be especially instrumental in shaping the course of our students\u2019 lives. Character is formed and developed in times of deep adversity. This is the kind of teachable moment that Yeshiva University was made for. As such, we have developed an educational plan for next year that features a high-quality student experience and prioritizes personal growth during this Coronavirus era. Our students will be able to work through the difficulties, issues and opportunities posed by our COVID-19 era with our stellar rabbis and faculty, as well as their close friends and peers at Yeshiva. To develop our plans for the fall, we have convened a Scenario Planning Task Force made up of representatives across the major areas of our campus. Their planning has been guided by the latest medical information, government directives, direct input from our rabbis, faculty and students, and best practices from industry and university leaders across the country. I am deeply thankful to our task force members and all who supported them for their tireless work in addressing the myriad details involved in bringing students back to campus and restarting our educational enterprise. In concert with the recommendations from our task force, I am announcing today that our fall semester will reflect a hybrid model. It will allow many students to return in a careful way by incorporating online and virtual learning with on-campus classroom instruction. It also enables students who prefer to not be on campus to have a rich student experience by continuing their studies online and benefitting from a full range of online student services and extracurricular programs. In bringing our students back to campus, safety is our first priority. Many aspects of campus life will change for this coming semester. Gatherings will be limited, larger courses will move completely online. Throughout campus everyone will need to adhere to our medical guidelines, including social distancing, wearing facemasks, and our testing and contact tracing policies. Due to our focus on minimizing risk, our undergraduate students will begin the first few weeks of the fall semester online and move onto the campus after the Jewish holidays. This schedule will limit the amount of back and forth travel for our students by concentrating the on-campus component of the fall semester to one consecutive segment. Throughout our planning, we have used the analogy of a dimmer switch. Reopening our campuses will not be a simple binary, like an on/off light switch, but more like a dimmer in which we have the flexibility to scale backwards and forwards to properly respond as the health situation evolves. It is very possible that some plans could change, depending upon the progression of the virus and/or applicable state and local government guidance. Before our semester begins, we will provide more updates reflecting our most current guidance. Please check our website, yu.edu/fall2020 for regular updates. We understand that even after reading through this guide, you might have many additional questions, so we will be posting an extensive FAQ section online as well. Additionally, we will also be holding community calls for faculty, students, staff and parents over the next couple of months. Planning for the future during this moment has certainly been humbling. This Coronavirus has reminded us time and time again of the lessons from our Jewish tradition that we are not in full control of our circumstances. But our tradition also teaches us that we are in control of our response to our circumstances. Next semester will present significant challenges and changes. There will be some compromises and minor inconveniences--not every issue has a perfect solution. But faith and fortitude, mutual cooperation and resilience are essential life lessons that are accentuated during this period. And if we all commit to respond with graciousness, kindness, and love, we can transform new campus realities into profound life lessons for our future. Deeply rooted in our Jewish values and forward focused in preparing for the careers and competencies of the future, we journey together with you, our Yeshiva University community, through these uncharted waters. Next year will be a formative year in the lives of our students, and together we will rise to the moment so that our students will emerge stronger and better prepared to be leaders of the world of tomorrow.

The School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence cannot communicate over the phone or by email regarding the status of an application. We can only respond to a student whether or not ASU has received all of the required application materials. My ASU (https://students.asu.edu/) lists application materials required by Graduate Admissions; however, additional materials are required by the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence. Applications will not be reviewed until those additional materials are received. Once an admission decision is made by the Graduate Admissions Committee, the decision is forwarded to Graduate Admissions, who notifies students of the admissions decision. Students can view admissions decisions on My ASU (https://students.asu.edu/) . Neither, Graduate Admissions nor the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence can provide any information to an applicant\u2019s family members. This information is confidential and protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. What are the requirements to be admitted to a Master or Ph.D. program? Please refer to the Admission Requirements above. Students must submit an official ASU Graduate Admissions application, GRE scores, official transcripts and TOEFL scores (if applicable), statement of purpose, and three letters of recommendation. Admission to a SCAI program is competitive and is based on many factors, including undergraduate or graduate preparation and application materials. What are the requirements for letters of recommendation? Applicants to PhD programs (letters are not required for master\u2019s programs) will indicate three references to provide recommendations during the online application process. References will then receive an email to electronically submit their recommendation. References could be from current or former professors or employers who know your background and skills. What should I include in my statement of purpose? The statement of purpose is required for all applicants. Your statement of purpose should: 1) explain professional goals and reasons for desiring to enroll in the graduate program; 2) describe any research experiences; for Ph.D. and thesis option MS applicants 3) indicate personal research interests; and 4) identify two or three ASU faculty with matching research interests. You can search for faculty by area at https://graduate.asu.edu/graduate-faculty (https://graduateapps.asu.edu/graduate-faculty) . It is recommended that your statement of purpose is approximately 1-2 pages in length, concise, clear and informative. What is the minimum score you will accept for the GRE and English Language Proficiency? Check your programs minimum on the average GRE score chart in the Application Requirements section and also by clicking Average GRE Scores (https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Graduate-Record-Examination-Average-Scores.docx) . The University requires all international applicants from a country whose native language is not English (please see ASU\u2019s English Proficiency requirements (https://admission.asu.edu/international/graduate/english-proficiency) ) to provide the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IETLS) scores. SCAI uses an average score of 575 (paper-based) or 90 (internet-based) for TOEFL or 7 for IETLS or 65 for Pearson or 115 for Duolingo for admission. Please note that your application will not be processed until the university receives official English Proficiency scores, which are valid for two years from the start date of the degree program. Exemption from the English Proficiency requirement can be determined by visiting the Graduate Admission site under English Proficiency. Please address all English Proficiency questions to the Office of Graduate Admissions. The ASU institution code is 4007. If a department code is required, use 99 for TOEFL. Do I still have to complete the English proficiency if I have a Bachelors degree from an accredited U.S. institution? You do not need to take the TOEFL or IELTS if you graduated from an accredited U.S. institution. See the Graduate Admissions website (https://admission.asu.edu/international/graduate/english-proficiency) for details. Is there a"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/graduate-admissions/", "source": ["google"], "title": "Graduate Admissions - School of Computing and Augmented ..."}, "content": "TOEFL or IELTS if you graduated from an accredited U.S. institution. See the Graduate Admissions website (https://admission.asu.edu/international/graduate/english-proficiency) for details. Is there a way to waive the application fee? Application fee waivers may only be considered for PhD applicants at the direction of a sponsoring faculty. Can I apply after the deadline date? Students who meet the specified deadline date will be given top priority in our highly competitive programs. Students who submit applications and required materials after the deadline date take the chance on their applications not being reviewed or the application may be deferred to the next semester. The School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence does not accept applications for the summer term. Can I get an assistantship? The School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence evaluates each applicant and determines the awards for teaching assistantships (TA). TA positions are awarded primarily to Ph.D. students. RA positions are offered to the highest caliber of students. RA offers are made to admitted students by an interested faculty member. Some faculty members do not offer RA positions to newly admitted students. Students can contact a specific faculty member or members in their research area of interest regarding open positions. Students will be contacted by the faculty member if they are interested in hiring the student as an RA, as there is no formal application for an RA position. Students are encouraged to submit a CV or resume with their application for review by the faculty in the student\u2019s research area of interest. Can I send unofficial documentation or does it have to be official documentation? Please review the application steps and requirements on the Graduate Admissions website (https://admission.asu.edu/graduate/apply) . Applications will be released to the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence once all required documents are received. Please send all materials directly to Graduate Admissions. Graduate Admissions Contact Information (https://admission.asu.edu/contact) Graduate Admissions FAQ (https://admission.asu.edu/contact/faqs#graduate) Will you evaluate my resume and tell me if I am qualified for admission? We do not pre-evaluate student credentials. Students are encouraged to talk with our faculty to discuss their research interests and educational/professional background and then apply for admission. The Graduate Admissions committee will evaluate each application file and determine if they are eligible for the program or not. The Graduate College makes the final determination on acceptance. How long will it take me to graduate? The master\u2019s degree programs typically take two years to complete. The Ph.D. program typically takes between 4-6 years beyond the bachelor\u2019s degree to complete. If I take classes from another university, how many of them can I transfer to ASU? The number of transfer credits allowed for M.S. students varies by program and is subject to review and approval. Please review the handbook (https://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/graduate/) for your program regarding how many transfer credits are permitted. Ph.D. students with a master\u2019s degree from an accredited institution can transfer in up to 30 semester hours into the Ph.D. program, plus an additional 12 semester hours of graduate coursework not used in any other degree program. A Ph.D. student without a master\u2019s degree can transfer in 12 semester hours of graduate coursework. All coursework must be approved by the Graduate Program Chair and have a grade of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d. No grades of \u201cPass\u201d or \u201cSatisfactory\u201d can be transferred. Is there an option for conditional admission? The School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence does not admit students on a conditional basis. Students may be admitted with graduate deficiencies, which need to be completed within the first year of the degree program. Click on Deficiency Courses above to see the list. How much will the degree cost? Review ASU\u2019s Student Business Services website (https://students.asu.edu/tuitionandbilling/) for information about tuition costs. Can I apply to a graduate program with a 3 year Bachelor\u2019s degree from an international institution? A student must have the equivalent of a 4 year bachelor\u2019s degree to be eligible to apply for a graduate program. Students can take one year of a master\u2019s program in their home country to be equivalent to a bachelor\u2019s degree. Any questions should be directed to Graduate Admissions (https://admission.asu.edu/graduate) . Can I be accepted into a Master or Ph.D program if I don\u2019t have an engineering background? The School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence admits students from a variety of backgrounds including Statistics, Mathematics, and Physics. Students may gain admissions with undergraduate deficiencies, but are also encouraged to apply as a non-degree seeking graduate student to complete any"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/graduate-admissions/", "source": ["google"], "title": "Graduate Admissions - School of Computing and Augmented ..."}, "content": "background? The School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence admits students from a variety of backgrounds including Statistics, Mathematics, and Physics. Students may gain admissions with undergraduate deficiencies, but are also encouraged to apply as a non-degree seeking graduate student to complete any needed deficiencies before applying to the degree program. Students are required to complete deficiency courses by the end of their first year in the program. Can I pursue a thesis-oriented Master\u2019s degree? Yes. Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Robotics and Autonomous Systems- AI, Data Science, Analytics and Engineering- Computing and Decision and Software Engineering all have both a thesis and non-thesis option. Students will be able to pursue a thesis after you are admitted to ASU and find a faculty advisor. What is the difference between MS CS and MCS? The Master of Computer Science is a portfolio based Masters program primarily housed on our online campus with no option for thesis. The Master of Science in Computer Science program allows for a thesis and non-thesis portfolio option. Tempe campus students are recommended to apply for this option to allow for more flexibility in their culminating experience without having to do a plan change. All students are admitted as non-thesis to start, then when students fill out their IPOS they can select thesis or portfolio as their culminating event. Both programs require the same amount of CSE 5XX courses and both programs are taught by the same faculty. Ready to apply? Apply now through the Graduate College online graduate application.
