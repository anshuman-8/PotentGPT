Each dish was a testament to Chef Vijay culinary prowess, leaving my taste buds in a state of sheer bliss. But it wasn\u2019t just the food that left a lasting impression. Chef Vijay punctuality was remarkable. The dishes were served right on time, and it was evident that attention to detail and timeliness were paramount to him. Beyond his culinary skills, his warm and friendly demeanor added an extra layer of comfort to the dining experience. His enthusiasm for sharing his creations and engaging with diners created a welcoming atmosphere that enhanced the overall enjoyment of the meal. Kudos to Chef Vijay for his remarkable talents and exceptional service!

I needed preparation for ~ 15 people with both veg and non-veg items. I wanted to try professional chef as i invited couple of vegetarian families and preparation of vegetarian food wasn't our forte. I got reference of coox.in from one of my colleague. Chef Ram Babu was tasked to prepare both veg and non-veg items. He is a very polite and a nice guy so the experience was good from the very beginning since he started at my home. Food quality was awesome and very tasty. Everybody in the party liked and enjoyed the food. But, we didn't like preparation of 1 item i.e. \"mutton Rogan josh\""}, {"metadata": "https://www.coox.in/cuisine/mughlai", "content": "Food quality was awesome and very tasty.

However, i would definitely like to recommend him and would love to use his service again in the future. +Load More (/reviews) Occasions Cooks and Chefs for Cricket World Cup \ud83c\udfcf Cooks and Chefs for Gurpurab \ud83d\udc73 Cooks and Chefs for For One Day \u261d\ud83c\udffc Cooks and Chefs for Birthday Party \ud83c\udf82 Cooks and Chefs for House Party \ud83e\udd73 Cooks and Chefs for Inviting Guests \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66 Cooks and Chefs for Pooja at Home \ud83d\ude4f Cooks and Chefs for Anniversary \u2764\ufe0f Cooks and Chefs for Roka Ceremony \ud83d\udc8d Cooks and Chefs for Mehendi Cocktail \ud83d\udc83 +Load More Cities Cooks and Chefs in Delhi Cooks and Chefs in Noida Cooks and Chefs in Gurugram Cooks and Chefs in Ghaziabad Cooks and Chefs in Faridabad Cooks and Chefs in Greater Noida Cooks and Chefs in Bengaluru Cooks and Chefs in Hyderabad Cooks and Chefs in Chennai Cooks and Chefs in Kolkata +Load More Other Cuisines North Indian Cooks and Chefs Chinese Cooks and Chefs Italian Cooks and Chefs South Indian Cooks and Chefs Continental Cooks and Chefs Barbecue Cooks and Chefs Ghar ka Khaana Cooks and Chefs Beverages Cooks and Chefs Desserts Cooks and Chefs Soups Cooks and Chefs +Load More Description"}, {"metadata": "https://www.coox.in/cuisine/mughlai", "content": "and Chefs Ghar ka Khaana Cooks and Chefs Beverages Cooks and Chefs Desserts Cooks and Chefs Soups Cooks and Chefs +Load More Description Hire a personal Chef, Cook for Mughlai Food for Birthday, House Party, Wedding, Special Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner at Home.

What is the maximum amount of people allowed for a Private Chef service? There is no maximum number of people, although a Private Chef service is usually carried out in a more intimate level along with friends or family, and usually in homes where space is limited. Even though there is no maximum number of people, generally the groups do not exceed 15 people. Does the Private Chef cook at my house? A Private Chef always prepares the menu at the client's home, as it is an inherent part of the experience. However, depending on the complexity of the menu, the chef may prepare a mise en place before going to the client's home, as some dishes take several hours to prepare and it would be impossible to execute all the steps at the client's home. Can I cook along with the Private Chef? Absolutely! Usually, there are always several food lovers among the diners who take the opportunity to share some time with the chef, learn some tricks in the kitchen and the step-by-step of each of the dishes on the menu. For those diners who really want to get hands on, they can of course join the chef and cook! Are the ingredients for a Private Chef service fresh? Every Private Chef gives the utmost importance to the freshness of the ingredients used in their menus. The main difference between a restaurant and a private chef is in the personalized treatment of each diner. The chef personalizes the menu, and based on that menu, makes the necessary purchases to develop the menu chosen by the customers. Therefore, the freshness of the ingredients is one of the key elements of a Private Chef service. Are drinks included in a Private Chef service? Drinks are not included by default. However, you can reach an agreement with the chef in order to add drinks as an \"extra\" to the menu proposal. How much should I tip a Private Chef in Delhi?
