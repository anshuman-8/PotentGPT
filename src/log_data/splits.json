We Ubered there and then walked back. The walk was about 45 minutes, which was probably what it would have taken in an Uber thanks to the post-game traffic.

View More Locations Cancel Pick-up Service Available To use our free pick-up service, call your Budget rental location directly at the location phone number listed on your reservation confirmation. Pick-up service policies (hours of availability, allowable pick-up distance, etc.) vary by location so it's important that you call the location and make arrangements for pick-up at least 24 hours before your desired rental time. When you call the location, be ready to provide all applicable information including precise address, exact time of pick up, and a phone number where you can be reached at that time. Please note that an off-airport Budget location cannot pick you up at an airport that has a Budget location. In this case, either you must rent your car at the airport location, or provide your own transportation to the off-airport location where you prefer to rent Adding the Location Index Component Map service down or some other scenarios map fails Moving the header to search.html as per latest visuals Moved header from map.html to be shown for loc-city pages only Santa Clara Car Rental & Nearby Locations <div class=\"pageError\" ng-show=\"vm.searchValidate\">We Can&#39;t find the location.
