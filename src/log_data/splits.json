These pumps have pump and motor temperature sensors installed. The iQ pumpset parameters can be monitored and displayed through a variety of output devices including: Hand-held or panel mounted control module; Local PC or laptop computer; OEM specified tool interface; PC as part of a fab-wide network. This is a hand held LCD control panel module provides access to: system control and configuration; system status and monitored values; diagnostics and recommended corrective action. A tool interface module can be used to provide a fully customized interface to your process tool. It communicates with the iQ pumping system through a screened twisted pair cable. It has integral system configuration which check process pump service history log, process/tool specific settings, updated on power-on, giving maximum pump interchangeability between process tools. Every dry vacuum pump we sell goes through a rigorous rebuild process at our Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM) location. Each pump is fully dismantled and all parts are decontaminated and inspected. Damaged or worn parts are replaced. All bearings, o-rings, seals, and gaskets are replaced. Rebuilt pumps are attached to our computer controlled pressure diagnostics system where their performance is monitored for 72-hours under varying load. Pumps are leak tested to ensure safety during operation. Final pump is cleaned and painted as required.

Units are assembled with new vanes, shaft seals, exhaust valves, gaskets, springs, oil distribution valves and bearings prior to undergoing an extended performance test to meet or exceed OEM specifications. All pumps are then painted, detailed, and pass a final quality assurance inspection prior to shipping. A final test certificate is provided with each pump, which will be covered with a one-year warranty. To meet the requirements for high throughputs with low ultimate vacuum, Edwards has developed a totally new concept in rotary vacuum pumps: The world's first dual-mode pump. The unique dual-mode action allows you to easily configure the unit to pump very high gas loads and also achieve excellent vacuum - all from a single pump. In most cases it increases performance at significantly reduced noise levels. This unique performance is matched by innovative design features including a cartridge based pumping mechanism incorporating advanced new materials, a fully featured Edwards motor and a fast acting inlet valve to seal the pump for suck-back protection. The pumps are easy to install, use and maintain with superior built quality to give lowest cost of ownership. To build a pump this advanced, Edwards has invested heavily in state-of-the-art manufacturing and assembly technology in a dedicated ISO9001 factory. Edwards RV - easy to install, use and maintain Installation is easy as all Edwards RV pumps feature a special dual voltage, dual frequency motor with an IEC mains input socket. Simply plug in the appropriate cable. No need for hard wiring. An on/off switch controls the pump. The motor voltage is determined by a simple rocker switch, enabling the pump to be easily configured for use internationally. All controls are clearly marked and have large finger grips for ease of use. Inlet and outlet are both fitted with standard NW25 flanges. Selectable dual mode High vacuum for best pressure High throughput mode for continuous inlet pressure above 50 mbar Easy to use gas ballast ON-OFF switch on pump Low Noise Level: 48 dbA All pumps factory tested and certified Easy to service and maintain Edwards Vacuum Pump RV12 10 cfm Specifications Specifications Hz Units RV 12 VACUUM DATA Peak pumping speed 60 cfm 8.4 50 m 3 /h 12 Ultimate pressure"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://avac.com/product/boc-edwards-vacuum-pump-40-22624-02-rv12-rebuilt/", "source": ["google"], "title": "Edwards Vacuum Pump RV12 | REBUILT w/ 1 Year Warranty"}, "content": "dbA All pumps factory tested and certified Easy to service and maintain Edwards Vacuum Pump RV12 10 cfm Specifications Specifications Hz Units RV 12 VACUUM DATA Peak pumping speed 60 cfm 8.4 50 m 3 /h 12 Ultimate pressure (Total) 60 Torr 1.5 x 10 -3 50 mbar 2.0 x 10 -3 Ultimate pressure GB I (Total) 50/60 Torr 2.3 x 10 -2 mbar 3.0 x 10 -2 Ultimate pressure GB II (Total) 50/60 Torr 9.1 x 10 -2 mbar 1.2 x 10 -1 High throughput mode 50/60 Torr 2.3 x 10 -2 mbar 3.0 x 10 -2 Water vapor tolerance Torr 24 mbar 32 Water vapor capacity - GB I g/h 60 Water vapor capacity - GB II g/h 290 MOTOR DATA Motor rating 1 phase (nominal) 60 W 550 50 W 450 Motor rating 3 phase W Nominal rotation speed 60 rpm 1800 50 rpm 1500 PHYSICAL DATA Weight lb 58 kg 26.3 Length inch 19.3 mm 490 Width inch 6.2 mm 158 Height inch 8.9 mm 225 Oil capacity liters 1 Inlet flange NW25 Exhaust flange NW25 Noise level 50 dBA 48 Operating temperature range \u00b0C 12 to 40 Click Below for Specification Sheet RV Rotary Vane Pumps Categories: 2 Stage Vacuum Pump , Edwards , Edwards , Edwards Medium Vacuum Pumps , Edwards Vacuum Wet , Level of Vacuum Medium Extraction , Level of Vacuum: Medium Vacuum , Level Vacuum Edwards Extraction , Medium Edwards Extraction , Medium Edwards Vacuum Pumps , Medium Vacuum Rotary Vane , Medium Wet Edwards Vacuum , Rebuilt , Rebuilt Edwards Extraction , Rebuilt Edwards Extraction Equipment , Rebuilt Edwards Medium Vacuum , Rebuilt Edwards Vacuum Pumps , Rebuilt Extraction Equipment , Rebuilt Medium Vacuum , Rebuilt Rotary Vane Edwards , Rebuilt Rotary Vane Medium Edwards , Rebuilt Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump for Sale , Rebuilt Vacuum Pumps , Rebuilt Vacuum Pumps , Rebuilt Vacuum Pumps Extraction , Rebuilt Wet Edwards , Rebuilt Wet Edwards Extraction , Rebuilt Wet Edwards Medium Vacuum , Rebuilt Wet Medium Vacuum Pumps , Rebuilt Wet Rotary Vane Medium , Rebuilt Wet Vacuum Pump , Rebuilt Wet Vacuum Pumps , Rotary Vane , Rotary Vane Edwards , Rotary Vane Medium Edwards , Sale Refurbish Pumps , Vacuum Pumps , Vacuum Pumps , Wet , Wet Edwards Extraction Equipment , Wet Medium Vacuum Pumps , Wet Rotary Vane , Wet Vacuum Pumps Related products Alcatel Adixen 2010SD Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump 6.8 cfm NEW 210SDMLAM 1PH Request a Quote Edwards Vacuum Pump RV12"}, {"metadata": {"website": "https://avac.com/product/boc-edwards-vacuum-pump-40-22624-02-rv12-rebuilt/", "source": ["google"], "title": "Edwards Vacuum Pump RV12 | REBUILT w/ 1 Year Warranty"}, "content": ", Wet Rotary Vane , Wet Vacuum Pumps Related products Alcatel Adixen 2010SD Rotary Vane Vacuum Pump 6.8 cfm NEW 210SDMLAM 1PH Request a Quote Edwards Vacuum Pump RV12 10 CFM NEW A65501906 115 /208-230 V 1 PHASE 50 / 60 HZ 1PH Request a Quote Welch 1402 Vacuum Pump 1402 5.6 cfm NEW 1402B-01 115V/60HZ IPH Request a Quote A-VAC Industries, Inc.

These pumps have pump and motor temperature sensors installed. The iQ pumpset parameters can be monitored and displayed through a variety of output devices including: Hand-held or panel mounted control module; Local PC or laptop computer; OEM specified tool interface; PC as part of a fab-wide network. This is a hand held LCD control panel module provides access to: system control and configuration; system status and monitored values; diagnostics and recommended corrective action. A tool interface module can be used to provide a fully customized interface to your process tool. It communicates with the iQ pumping system through a screened twisted pair cable. It has integral system configuration which check process pump service history log, process/tool specific settings, updated on power-on, giving maximum pump interchangeability between process tools. Every dry vacuum pump we sell goes through a rigorous rebuild process at our Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM) location. Each pump is fully dismantled and all parts are decontaminated and inspected. Damaged or worn parts are replaced. All bearings, o-rings, seals, and gaskets are replaced.
