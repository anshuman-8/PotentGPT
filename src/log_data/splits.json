Testimonials What customers say Hospitality Redefined The hotels in Thanisandra, were brand new, and the rooms and service were really good. We were told that they just started providing restaurant services. Although the menu was limited, the food was great, and the service was good. The only point of improvement we can suggest would be better communication between the staff. Although the receptionist first promised us a late checkout without extra charge, the next day another group of people were adamant about charging late checkout fees for both rooms which we had to pay.

Frequently asked questions Can I cancel my booking? Yes \u2013 any cancellation fees are determined by the property and listed in your cancellation policy. You'll pay any additional costs to the property. If I need to cancel my booking, will I pay a fee? If you have a free cancellation booking, you won't pay a cancellation fee. If your booking isn't free to cancel anymore or is non-refundable, you may incur a cancellation fee. Any cancellation fees are determined by the property, and you'll pay any additional costs to the property. Who's going to charge my credit card and when? Generally, the property is responsible for charging your card. If payment is instead handled by Booking.com, this will be stated clearly in your booking confirmation. You usually can expect to pay during check-in or check-out at the property. However, there are some exceptions, like properties that require a prepayment for all or some of the total amount. Again, this will be stated clearly in your confirmation and payment policies. If there's no prepayment policy, it\u2019s also possible that the property might take a test payment from your card before you stay. This is a temporary hold, that\u2019s used to validate your card and guarantee your booking. Unlike a real charge, this test payment will be returned to your card. Can I make changes to my booking (i.e. change dates)? Yes! You can make changes to your booking from your confirmation email or at Booking.com. Depending on the property's policy, you can do the following: Change check-in/out times Change dates Cancel booking Edit credit card details Change guest details Select bed type Change room type Add a room Add a meal Make a request Contact the property I can't find my confirmation email. What should I do? Be sure to check your email inbox, spam, and junk folders.

Can I make a reservation without a credit card? You'll need a valid credit card to guarantee your reservation with most properties. However, we offer a number of hotels that will guarantee your booking without a card. You can also make a booking by using someone else\u2019s card, provided you have their permission. In this case, confirm the card holder\u2019s name and that you have permission to use their card in the \"Special requests\" box when booking. Why was I charged? The charge you see could be any one of the following: Pre-authorization: A pre-authorization is just a validity check that temporarily blocks an amount roughly equivalent to the cost of your reservation on your credit card. The amount will be unblocked after a certain amount of time. How long this takes will depend on the property and your credit card provider. Deposit or prepayment: Some properties require a deposit or prepayment at the time of reservation. This policy is clearly highlighted during the reservation process, and you can see it in your confirmation email as well. If your reservation allows for free cancellation, this amount is returned to you if you choose to cancel it. Our Customer Service team is always there if you need help with a payment issue. You can go to booking.com/help to get in touch with us. How do I find out if properties allow pets? Pet policies are always displayed on the property\u2019s page under \"House rules.\" See all frequently asked questions Go to the Help Center Save time, save money!

Yoga Med India Explore guest reviews of hotels in Bangalore See all Elite Peak Serviced Apartments Bangalore From $37.82 per night 9.1 Wonderful \u00b7 29 reviews We may pay in the range of 2-4k for any decent hotels in Bangalore good location. Hotel provides just a room with attached toilets. But this service apartment provides 2 rooms with attached toilets, spacious hall, balconies, kitchen. As usual, TV, sofas, AC, kitchen utensils, broadband connection, power backup, security, car parking are additional attractive in this service apartment. So overall 2 BHK furnished flats comes for 4k rent per day.

With the entrance of the Silicon Valley, it has embraced change. From laidback to quick-paced, from local to global, from the traditionalist to the modernist, but always welcoming, as a people and as a hotel. Its d\u00e9cor mirrors this change with its chic, new age furnishing. Old recipes are made with a lighter hand. Cocktails are now made by mixologists who dabble fearlessly - revitalizing traditional recipes with new ingredients. Newly refreshed elegance is everywhere as is state-of-the-art technology. Location-wise, you are in the heart of Bangalore, equidistant to both - the centres of culture and the hubs of technology. Attractions near our hotel in Bangalore include Lal Bagh, Commercial Street and the 1 MG-Lido Mall. For business, there\u2019s the business centre, an up-to-date boardroom with audio-visual facilities. For pleasure, trust our Concierge to plan anything your heart desires, from romantic dinners to sightseeing tours. Fall in love with this city and you won\u2019t be able to stop yourself from falling in love with us as well. As the city surrounds you in its warm embrace, so do we. And you will find yourself returning to us both, again and again.
