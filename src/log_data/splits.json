I got several quotes by email and on this message board, but my question is where do I find reviews for these car rental (/RentalCars-g297633-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html) agencies. The rates are mostly in the same bracket, so I would rather choose based on review or prior experience from other travelers.

Re: Car rental reviews 10 years ago Save No, I haven't. Just booked through Expressions Kerala (expressionskerala@gmail.com), will let you know how it turns out. From talking to them, it seems the reviews are going to be a wash anyway. Most of these companies do not have their own cars (/RentalCars-g297633-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html) /drivers. They sub-contract it out to independent cars (/RentalCars-g297633-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html) /drivers.

Re: Car rental reviews 9 years ago Save Wanted to share our experience with CochinCarRentals(TourWorldHolidays) We rented an Innova car (/RentalCars-g297633-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html) for 8 days as a package Kochi (/Tourism-g297633-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala-Vacations.html) - Munnar (/Tourism-g303881-Munnar_Idukki_District_Kerala-Vacations.html) -Alleypey-Kochi. Our experience with driver Mr. Prince has been very disappointing. Though it was promised to us that the vehicle and the driver will be available for 8 days, this person would vanish to his home without informing, would claim that he is too tired to drive after driving for only 4/5 hours and would argue when asked to drive slower. Once after dropping us at a beach he vanished on the pretext of having tea and when he came back he alleged that one of his door locks has been broken and started to demand extra money. It was also very disappointing that the agency would never return calls when asked to intervene or at least help locate the driver. Maybe the agency outsources and hence has minimal control over the drivers. When I recall the wonderful days we spent in Kerala, the only sour spot was this car rental"}, {"metadata": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g297633-i7524-k6945823-Car_rental_reviews-Kochi_Cochin_Ernakulam_District_Kerala.html", "content": "at least help locate the driver.
