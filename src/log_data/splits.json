System is a microprocessor controlled, modular, dry pump package that provides unparalleled control and monitoring facilities. The iQ pumping system can be locally controlled by a hand held LCD control panel or remotely controlled through a fully customized tool interface. All major control elements are located within the footprint of the pumping system.The iQ dry pumping system has integrated sensors, which continuously monitor key system performance parameters and give advanced warning of problems. These pumps have pump and motor temperature sensors installed. The iQ pumpset parameters can be monitored and displayed through a variety of output devices including: Hand-held or panel mounted control module; Local PC or laptop computer; OEM specified tool interface; PC as part of a fab-wide network. This is a hand held LCD control panel module provides access to: system control and configuration; system status and monitored values; diagnostics and recommended corrective action. A tool interface module can be used to provide a fully customized interface to your process tool. It communicates with the iQ pumping system through a screened twisted pair cable. It has integral system configuration which check process pump service history log, process/tool specific settings, updated on power-on, giving maximum pump interchangeability between process tools. Every dry vacuum pump we sell goes through a rigorous rebuild process at our Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM) location. Each pump is fully dismantled and all parts are decontaminated and inspected. Damaged or worn parts are replaced. All bearings, o-rings, seals, and gaskets are replaced. Rebuilt pumps are attached to our computer controlled pressure diagnostics system where their performance is monitored for 72-hours under varying load. Pumps are leak tested to ensure safety during operation. Final pump is cleaned and painted as required.

60HZ 3PH. PN- A07115770 This is a motor for the Drypumping System microprocessor controlled, modular, dry pump package that provides unparalleled control and monitoring facilities. i/QDP pumps have enclosed, water-cooled motors and are therefore suitable for applications in clean environments where fan cooling is unacceptable.The pump-motor is cooled by water flowing through a cooling jacket which surrounds the motor. The pump-motor cooling circuit is separate from the pump cooling circuit. The cooling-water supply and return pipelines are connected to the pump by connectors on the water services panel at one end of the pump. The iQ dry pumping system has integrated sensors, which continuously monitor key system performance parameters and give advanced warning of problems including pump and motor temperature, by way of integrated sensors. Three motor-protection thermistors are fitted to the pump-motor (one on each winding). These thermistors are solid-state devices which have an electrical resistance of 100 to 500 Ohms at normal pump-motor operational temperature. When the pump-motor is too hot, the electrical resistance rises quickly to 3000 Ohms. The thermistors are connected in series and you can use the output of the thermistors to shut down the pump because the motor is too hot. These motors are supplied configured for \u2018low voltage\u2019 operation (200-208 V at 50 Hz or 200-230 V at 60 Hz). To change the i/QDP80 Pump-motor to \u2018high voltage\u2019 operation, remove the pump-motor terminal-box cover, then remove the wires from the U1, V1 and W1 terminals.

Chiller Trillium TCU 40/80 Plus Chiller TCU 40/80 Chiller Plus The TCU 40/80 Plus Chiller, originally manufactured by BOC Edwards, was designed as original equipment for the LAM 2300 series of etch platforms. It features robust construction, long mean time between failure and fluorinated cooling fluids, which eliminate the need for on board deionization systems. To conserve floor space, the TCU 40/80 Plus can be stacked with another unit, either directly on top of each other or through the use of a special stacking frame. In 2009 Trillium acquired the chiller and heat exchanger product lines from Edwards. Trillium provides End Users worldwide support, repair service and spare parts, as well as New and Refurbished TCU 40/80 Pluses.

"BOC Edwards iQDP80 Dry Semiconductor DryStar Vacuum Pump Rebuilt"}, "content": "(USD) Description BOC Edwards iQDP80 (iQDP-80) Dry Semiconductor DryStar Vacuum Pump Rebuilt The iQ Drypumping System is a microprocessor controlled, modular, dry pump package that provides unparalleled control and monitoring facilities. The iQ pumping system can be locally controlled by a hand held LCD control panel or remotely controlled through a fully customized tool interface. All major control elements are located within the footprint of the pumping system.The iQ dry pumping system has integrated sensors, which continuously monitor key system performance parameters and give advanced warning of problems. These pumps have pump and motor temperature sensors installed. The iQ pumpset parameters can be monitored and displayed through a variety of output devices including: Hand-held or panel mounted control module; Local PC or laptop computer; OEM specified tool interface; PC as part of a fab-wide network. This is a hand held LCD control panel module provides access to: system control and configuration; system status and monitored values; diagnostics and recommended corrective action. A tool interface module can be used to provide a fully customized interface to your process tool. It communicates with the iQ pumping system through a screened twisted pair cable. It has integral system configuration which check process pump service history log, process/tool specific settings, updated on power-on, giving maximum pump interchangeability between process tools. Every dry vacuum pump we sell goes through a rigorous rebuild process at our Albuquerque, New Mexico (NM) location. Each pump is fully dismantled and all parts are decontaminated and inspected. Damaged or worn parts are replaced. All bearings, o-rings, seals, and gaskets are replaced. Rebuilt pumps are attached to our computer controlled pressure diagnostics system where their performance is monitored for 72-hours under varying load. Pumps are leak tested to ensure safety during operation. Final pump is cleaned and painted as required.

BTW, nice results on Tuesday don't you think. Good job Tony!\u201d \u201cJust a heads up, I have finished testing the SDE120\u2019s we got on the last delivery and they have fantastic vacuum. So, just to let you know they all tested around 1mT or less. The pump down times were really good too. I think all of them were under 5mT in under 10 minutes. Let the guys know to keep up the good work.\u201d \u201cMet with the owner for a long visit and toured the company as a customer for the vacuum pump product they are releasing. It is a well run operation, with great leadership. This company is inventive, they clearly have developed the products that we need, and the reliabilty we require. I predict they will continue to roll out successful products.\u201d \u201cYou have always done an excellent job in meeting our needs and supporting us. That's why I always call you first for our vacuum related needs.\u201d \"I just wanted to thank you for getting us pumps as fast as you have, to include good quality work.\" You and your team kicked butt this weekend and made it possible to get my tool back up and running with the new Edwards STP-A1303C turbo, to include a Saturday delivery. This was greatly appreciated by many to include me. Please send thanks to Van also for his help over the phone with testing these turbos and for getting the new one ready to go so fast. \"This is a Thank You to Dave. He comes in with a professional attitude daily and is always willing to help us with our pump needs. I rely on Dave to keep an eye on my pumps and assist with any repairs needed to keep our pumps running, either electrical or mechanical\u2026\" \u201cEveryone is wonderful to work with. They go out of their way when I need something right away.\u201d \"This week has been extremely busy and Ben stepped up his game(as usual) to ensure that the customer\u2019s needs were exceeded. This was recognized by the production manager and he gave Ben a Kudo\u2019s(meal card for the cafeteria).\" Michele, Thanks to you and to everyone at Highvac for great support.

QDP80 Dry Pumps Edwards QDP80 Dry Pump Description: The Edwards QDP Series Dry Pumps are an excellent choice for primary pumping requirements in a wide range of applications. Their low capital and repair cost, ease of operation and interface ability with a wide range of process tools make them the preferred choice for upgrading rotary vane pumping systems. Following the 1st generation of air cooled Edwards CDP and DP series dry pumps, the QDP80 was launched featuring a more quiet water cooled motor and built in functionality for integration to a parent system. This 2nd generation of dry pumps from Edwards became the work horse of the semiconductor Industry in the mid 90\u2019s, and many thousands are still in use today. Mechanically, the QDP80 shares essentially the same pump module as its predecessors, as well as its successor, the iQDP. The QDP gas purge system, while functionally similar to the iQDP as well, is set and adjusted manually. The QDP electrical and electronic controls and sensors are provided by separate control modules available in varying degrees of sophistication.
